        A man lured a 13-year-old girl into his car on a Queens street yesterday, groped her and threatened her with scissors before she was able to escape, the police said.
        The girl, on the way to school, was walking at 48th Avenue and 92nd Street in Elmhurst at 8 a.m. when a dark-colored Lincoln Town Car pulled up and the driver asked for directions, the police said.
        After the girl approached the driver's side of the car and began giving directions, she was almost hit by a passing vehicle, so the driver told her to get into the car, the police said.
        The man drove to 50th Avenue and 97th Street, stopped the car, then groped the girl and tried to undress her, telling her he was a police officer and was searching her for weapons.
        When the man held a pair of scissors to her neck, the girl screamed, drawing the attention of a man walking by, the police said.
        The passer-by intervened and the girl was able to escape, the police said.
        The police are looking to speak to the passer-by, too.
