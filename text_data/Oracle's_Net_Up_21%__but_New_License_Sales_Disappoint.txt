        The Oracle Corporation, the software company, reported continued strong profit growth yesterday, but the company's stock dipped in late trading when softness in new license revenue disappointed investors.
        Oracle said fiscal second-quarter profits rose 21 percent and revenue increased 26 percent as the company continued to benefit from acquisitions made in the last three years.
        But company executives said that they failed to close some crucial licensing deals during the quarter as they had hoped and that there were few large deals during the period. As a result, even though new license sales of Oracle's software applications rose 28 percent, to $340 million, it was the lightest growth in four quarters and far from the 80 percent growth the segment enjoyed in the first quarter.
        Oracle executives said yesterday that the problem would be resolved when the company closed those deals in subsequent quarters.
        ''We believe it comes down to execution,'' said Safra A. Catz, Oracle's co-president, in a conference call with analysts, adding that the company would adopt ''additional focus and better pipeline management.''
        Net income at Oracle for the quarter, ended Nov. 30, rose to $967 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $798 million, or 15 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
        Oracle said it would have earned 22 cents a share, matching analysts' forecasts, had it not been for expenses related to acquisitions and employee stock options.
        Revenue rose to $4.16 billion, from $3.29 billion, slightly beating analysts' forecasts of $4.15 billion.
        Revenue from new software licenses jumped to $1.21 billion in the quarter, from $1.06 billion last year.
        Analysts had been concerned that Oracle's database sales would be soft, but those concerns were overshadowed by the new softness in the applications business. New license sales of Oracle's database software increased 9 percent, to $867 million.
        The lighter-than-expected new license revenue caused Oracle's shares to decline 2.5 percent, or 45 cents, in after-hours trading, after rising 23 cents, to $17.91 in the regular session.
        It was the fourth consecutive quarter that Oracle's profit rose at least 20 percent, making good on the pledge of Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive, that annual growth would be at least that much for the next five years. In the last three years, Oracle spent more than $20 billion on acquisitions, including buying two of its most formidable competitors, PeopleSoft and Siebel.
        Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said the license numbers were causing investors to wonder if the benefits of Oracle's takeover spree were starting to slow.
        Oracle increasingly views the sales of software applications as a growth engine, in part because database sales have started to slow. Mr. Ellison said he expected sales to vertical markets like retailing to bolster growth in applications, and pointed to a $10 billion contract with Wal-Mart as an example.
        The company expects net income to increase 24 percent to 29 percent in the third quarter, and revenue to rise 23 percent to 25 percent.
        ''This was a quarter where they fell short,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''But I don't think the year is going to be as bad as this quarter was.''
