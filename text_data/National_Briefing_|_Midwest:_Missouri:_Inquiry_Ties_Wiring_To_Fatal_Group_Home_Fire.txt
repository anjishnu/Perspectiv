        Hours before a fire killed 10 people in a group home for the mentally ill and disabled on Nov. 27 in Anderson, a maintenance worker trying to repair a furnace short-circuited wiring in the attic, where fire investigators said they believed that the fire started. The worker told investigators that he did not know which circuit breaker operated the furnace and that he deliberately tripped the system, according to a report from the Missouri Fire Safety Division. The wiring may have become overloaded, the report staid. The fire marshal said the home did not have sprinklers. The report was obtained by The Associated Press under an open-records law.
