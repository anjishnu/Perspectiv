        Lynne Meadow, below, who has been the artistic director of Manhattan Theater Club for 34 years, is planning to take a sabbatical for the 2007-8 season. ''I'm really looking forward to a chance to be away from the daily management and think about some bigger things,'' she said, adding that she plans to travel to see what other theaters around the country are doing. As for what those bigger things may mean for MTC, she said, ''If I could say exactly what it was, then I probably wouldn't want this sabbatical.'' Daniel Sullivan, who directed ''Proof'' and ''Sight Unseen,'' among other MTC productions, will step in as acting artistic director, and has been consulting with Ms. Meadow on the 2007-8 season. She will, in turn, consult with him as he plans the 2008-9 season. Ms. Meadow plans to begin her sabbatical in August 2007.
