        Not all holiday fruitcakes are dense, syrupy and destined for regifting. Consider the house-made panettone at Leonetti Pastry Shop in Greenvale. This traditional Italian confection, more of a sweet bread than a cake, is fragrant with candied orange peel and studded with tiny raisins and toasted almonds; it has the airy texture and sweetness of soft challah. Delicate enough to toast for breakfast, the panettone comes plain ($16.50) or filled with Grand Marnier cream and covered with chocolate ganache ($24) for a decadent dessert.
        Saverio Leonetti recreates the pastries that captivated him as a child in Bari in southern Italy. ''I would get one pastry and it would take me a half-hour just to eat it,'' he recalled. ''I wanted to understand how it was made.'' That curiosity led him to train as a pastry chef in Italy. He came to the United States in 1990 to work in a bakery in Syosset and opened his own shop six years ago.
        ''I like to do a little bit of everything,'' Mr. Leonetti said. His specialties include an impressive array of cookies and small pastries (most $13 a pound) and beautifully decorated mousse cakes in a rotation of flavors like chocolate, mango, pistachio and raspberry (six-inch cake, $18; eight-inch, $26.50). Twenty-four flavors of house-made gelato ($3.25 a small serving, $4.75 large, $6.25 a pint) are displayed next to baskets of Italian bread ($2.25) and apple strudel logs ($16.95).
        In addition to the panettone, Leonetti's holiday specials include centerpieces of croccante ($26), or almond brittle, marzipan baskets filled with cookies ($18 for the basket, and cookies at $13 a pound), and molded chocolate sleighs ($18.50 small, $45 large).
        A dozen bistro tables fill the space between pastry cases, where customers can sit with morning coffee ($1.75), afternoon cappuccino ($3) or after-dinner espresso ($2.25), fine chasers to a selection of sweets from the old country.
        Leonetti Pastry Shop, 82-16 Glen Cove Road, Greenvale; (516) 625-8242. Open daily from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m., until 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.
