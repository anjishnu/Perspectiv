        Although laboratory tests last spring found no DNA from three Duke University lacrosse players on the body or clothes of a woman who accused them of rape, further tests found traces of DNA from several other men, defense lawyers said in a court filing. But the lawyers said the laboratory had failed to include those results in its summary report of its findings, and they asked the judge to order the laboratory's director to turn over more information and submit to questioning under oath. The lawyers wrote, ''This is strong evidence of innocence in a case in which the accuser denied engaging in any sexual activity in the days before the alleged assault, told police she last had consensual sexual intercourse a week before the assault, and claimed that her attackers did not use condoms and ejaculated.''
