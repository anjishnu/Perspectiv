        A chair as a gift? At Poltrona Frau, the idea suddenly seems more feasible. The Italian furnituremaker has packaged its (disassembled) Viking chair in an easy-to-carry white gift box tied with an orange ribbon. The recipient would need an Allen wrench -- and perhaps a sturdy wrist -- to put the pieces together. Customized versions of the design, which is Scandinavian-inspired, with a padded upholstered seat on a curved frame of oak or wenge wood, can be ordered in a range of fabrics, leathers and wood stains. Gift-boxed models in natural oak with dark brown leather or in wenge with cream leather are ready to go at the company's SoHo store, for $2,700 each. The Poltrona Frau store is at 145 Wooster Street (Houston Street); (212) 777-7592; frauusa.com.  CURRENTS: CHAIR IN A BOX
