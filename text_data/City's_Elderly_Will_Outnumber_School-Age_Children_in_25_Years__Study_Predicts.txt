        New York City is growing bigger and grayer. Within 25 years or so, elderly New Yorkers will outnumber school-age children for the first time, projections released this week show.
        Fully one-third of the population gain in the first three decades of the 21st century -- a projected growth rate of nearly 14 percent, slower than between 1980 and 2000 -- is expected to be among people over 65. That is a shift that carries potentially major policy implications for health care, housing, transportation and other issues.
        ''It's a question of where resources need to go,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the planning department's population division. ''The challenges we face are going to be different.''
        By 2030, the number of New Yorkers over age 65 is expected to soar by 400,000, or 44 percent. They would account for nearly 15 percent of the population, compared with less than 12 percent in 2000.
        In Staten Island, where the number of elderly is projected to double, their share of the population would rise to 19 percent, from 12 percent in 2000. Citywide, the number 85 and older would increase by about 25 percent.
        The city's population, estimated most recently at 8.2 million, is projected to hit 8.4 million in 2010, 8.7 million in 2020 and 9.1 million in 2030. Queens and Staten Island will reach new highs and Brooklyn and the Bronx will approach their historic peaks, with Brooklyn remaining the most populous and Manhattan growing the second fastest of any borough, the Department of City Planning estimates.
        The largest numerical increase, 336,000, is anticipated for Queens; the largest percentage gain, 24 percent, for Staten Island.
        In 1950, the proportion of school-age children was double that of the elderly.
        By 2030, with the proportion of children declining, both shares are expected to be about equal.
        After that, officials anticipate that people over 65 will outnumber New Yorkers from the ages of 5 to 17.
        The number of school-age children is expected to rise slightly in Manhattan and significantly in Queens and Staten Island, but decline over all in the city by 70,000 from 2005 to 2020 to 1.36 million because of declining birthrates, migration and a shrinking share of women of childbearing age.
        The number would begin to rise again after 2020.
        The planning department's projections were issued one day after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a campaign to engage the public in helping his Sustainability Advisory Board, led by Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, plan how the city can cope with a rising population. The board will examine the impact the increasing numbers could have on the environment and on aging systems that provide power, water and transportation.
        Population projections are subject to lots of variables and, historically, those predictions have tended to overestimate growth.
        The planning department's estimates assume that people will live longer. Also, that immigrants -- who typically have higher birthrates than native-born New Yorkers -- will continue to come at about the same pace, but that beginning in 2010 migration from the city will increase because housing elsewhere in the metropolitan area will become more available as elderly suburban homeowners die or retire to other states.
        ''The region is aging even faster than the city,'' Mr. Salvo said.
        The median age in the city is projected to rise from 34.2 in 2000 to 37.4 in 2030, and range then from 33.3 in the Bronx to 39.5 in Manhattan.
