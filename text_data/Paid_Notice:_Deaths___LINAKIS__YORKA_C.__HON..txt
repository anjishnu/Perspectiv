        LINAKIS--Yorka C., Hon. Retired New York State Supreme Court Justice Yorka C. Linakis died peacefully in her home on Tuesday, December 12th, 2006, of congestive heart failure. She was 89 years old. Born to immigrant Greek parents, Dimitri and Angeliki Condeles, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, on June 5th, 1917, she was predeceased by her beloved husband John S. Linakis, a prominent real estate and insurance executive, and three sisters, Clara, Antonia, and Mary. A graduate of Brooklyn College, the M.B.A. program at New York University, and New York Law School, she was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1944. After nearly 30 years as an attorney, she was appointed in 1973 to the Family Court of the City of New York by Major John Lindsay, and reappointed by Mayor Abe Beame. She served in the Family Court until her 1979 election to the New York State Supreme Court (the only candidate, among 10, on the ballot to receive both Democratic and Republican endorsements). Justice Linakis presided in the Criminal Felony Trial Part until her mandatory retirement on December 31st, 1993. Following retirement she accepted special court assignments as law guardian for infants in estate and custody proceedings. Throughout her life she was involved in many inter-religious, charitable, and civic organizations. She and her husband were Godparents and benefactors of their parish, St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church, in Jamaica, New York. She was active in the Greek Orthodox Ladies National Philoptochos Society (for which she served as legal advisor beginning in 1960) and served on the Board of Trustees of the Archdiocese Leadership 100. Among many other honors, Justice Linakis was recipient of the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. One of her proudest moments came in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter designated her a member of the Olympic Flame Presidential Delegation to travel by Air Force One to her ancestral home on a mission to bring back the Olympic Flame to inaugurate and preside over that year's Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York. The Honorable Linakis is survived by her Goddaughter, Olga Zaferatos Karras, brother-in-law Al Sylvester, sister-in-law Phyllis Simitopoulos, nephew and niece, Gregory Mantsios and Paula Rothenberg, cousins Kiki Nicholas, Solon and Marsha Chris, Vasso Alexander, and their children.
