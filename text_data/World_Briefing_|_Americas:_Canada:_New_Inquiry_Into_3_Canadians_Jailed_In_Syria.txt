        The government agreed to start an inquiry into the cases of three men who say they were tortured in Syria because of information provided by Canada. In October 2001, Canadian investigators observed Abdullah Almalki and Maher Arar having lunch. Their discussion ultimately led to the deportation to Syria and subsequent torture of Mr. Arar, who was born in Syria, by the United States in 2002. An earlier inquiry concluded in September that the terrorism allegations against Mr. Arar were false. Mr. Almalki and the two other men, Ahmad Abou el-Maati and Muayyed Nureddin, were arrested separately when entering Syria in 2001, 2002 and 2003, eventually returned to Canada and never faced criminal charges. Separately, the Arar inquiry released a second report calling for tighter civilian overview of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and several other agencies. Meanwhile, lawyers in New York filed an appeal of a United States District Court decision in February that dismissed a lawsuit against the United States by Mr. Arar. That judge said the court could not act because of national security concerns.
