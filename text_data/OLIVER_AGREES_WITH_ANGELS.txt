        The former Mets relief pitcher Darren Oliver has agreed to a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels, his agent said yesterday. The contract is pending a physical and has a vesting option for a second year. The Yankees were believed to be interested in signing Oliver but did not make an offer.
        Oliver, a 36-year-old left-hander, was a pleasant surprise for the Mets last season, compiling a 4-1 record and a 3.44 earned run average pitching mostly in long relief. But the team made it clear that it had little interest in re-signing him.
        The Mets have lost two key members of their bullpen, which ranked first in earned run average in the National League at 3.25. Late last month, Chad Bradford signed a two-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles with an option for a third season. The Mets were unwilling to match the third season.
        The Mets' lack of interest in Oliver could signal that General Manager Omar Minaya is comfortable using the left-hander Dave Williams as a spot starter and long reliever. Williams was acquired from Cincinnati last May and pitched in six games for the Mets.
