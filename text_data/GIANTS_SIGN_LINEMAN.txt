        The Giants, nervous about the injury status of tackle Kareem McKenzie and center Shaun O'Hara, signed the veteran offensive lineman Steve Edwards, who started 24 games for the Bears from 2002-5. McKenzie (neck) and O'Hara (ankle) were hurt in Sunday's 27-13 win over the Panthers. Their availability for Sunday's game against the Eagles is uncertain. To make room on the roster, the Giants waived linebacker Chris Claiborne.
