        The police in Lafayette are investigating the vandalism Tuesday of a controversial Iraq memorial made up of hundreds of white crosses on a hillside. The police chief, Michael Fisher, said someone had apparently used a roller to spread black paint over a message in the memorial that reads, ''In Memory of 2,867 U.S. Troops Killed in Iraq.'' The memorial, conceived by Jeff Heaton, a local contactor and antiwar activist, provoked some angry reactions from those who thought it was unpatriotic or inappropriate. Others praised the sign as a moving protest.
