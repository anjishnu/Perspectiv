        A prison escapee who spent more than five months eluding the state police was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 40 years in prison for shooting a New York state trooper during a traffic stop. The sentence will run consecutively with a life term that the man, Ralph Phillips, 44, received a day earlier for shooting two other troopers, killing one of them. The sentencing yesterday was for shooting Trooper Sean M. Brown as he walked toward Mr. Phillips's car during a June 10 traffic stop. Trooper Brown spoke briefly at yesterday's sentencing, calling Mr. Phillips ''a no-good coward.''
