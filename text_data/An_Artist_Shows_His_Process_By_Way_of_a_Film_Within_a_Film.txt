        There's Matthew Barney's world, then there's the one that the rest of us inhabit, where Vaseline is strictly a salve for chapped lips and other rough bits, not a medium for artistic expression. In the aptly named documentary, ''Matthew Barney: No Restraint,'' we're invited to observe this artist as he films his most recent project, ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner Bjork dress up, drink tea and transform into whales.
        ''Not many people can understand what is art,'' says Masayuki Komatsu of the International Whaling Commission, who likens Mr. Barney to Picasso and welcomes the financial benefits of a project filmed at sea aboard a Japanese whaling vessel. Yet all is not smooth sailing as Mr. Barney attempts to explain his creative process while wrangling 45,000 pounds of petroleum jelly and a massive block of whale vomit.
        Meanwhile the ship's crew is suspicious of a meal consisting of whale-shaped entrees. ''I'm nervous,'' admits one unhappy sailor, gazing fearfully at a plate bearing a gelatinous, black-and-white mass. One would think he would be.
        Touching briefly on Mr. Barney's early athletic and modeling pursuits, Alison Chernick's film skims the surface of a strange and celebrated career. After a meager 72 minutes, the man who once stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as unknowable as ever.
