        Re ''Overnight Star? Well, It's Been a Long Night'' by Melba Newsome [Dec. 10]:
        Your article on Taylor Hicks was an insightful look at what an accomplished musician he is. But was it necessary to include references to his fans as ''mostly fawning middle-aged women,'' along with some atypical, laughable posts to his fan site? How sexist. How ageist. How condescending. Mr. Hicks's artistry and the fact that he has paid his dues draws most fans to him, and will lead me (yes, a middle-aged woman) to buy his albums and see him on tour. To imply that most of his fans are the kind of people who get upset if he utters a curse word or performs with a rapper is distorting reality and reaching for the easy joke.
