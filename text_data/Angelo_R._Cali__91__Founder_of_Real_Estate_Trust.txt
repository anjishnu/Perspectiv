        Angelo R. Cali, whose family-owned real estate development company merged with the Mack Company in 1997 to create one of the country's largest real estate investment trusts, died last Friday in Montclair, N.J., his hometown. He was 91.
        The death was confirmed by his brother, John, also of Montclair.
        Along with his brother and a friend, Edward Leshowitz, Mr. Cali started the Cali Realty Corporation in 1949. Over 30 years, it built more than 6,000 suburban homes and rental apartments in Morris, Passaic and Essex Counties, in New Jersey. In 1968 it started constructing office buildings and by 1994, when it went public, it owned 13 office buildings with 2.2 million square feet. It was then based in Cranford, N.J.
        In 1997, Cali Realty merged with the Mack Company of Rochelle Park, creating the Mack-Cali real estate investment trust, with combined assets of $3.5 billion and 22 million square feet of office space in 187 buildings. REITs, as real estate investment trusts are called, invest in real estate and pay most of their earnings as dividends to shareholders.
        With about half of its holdings in New Jersey, Mack-Cali now holds about $6.5 billion in assets, including 34.3 million square feet of space in 301 buildings, from Washington to Boston. In 2002, the company built two office buildings with a total of 1.5 million square feet of space at the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City.
        Angelo Richard Cali was born on June 16, 1915, in Trinidad, Colo., one of eight children of Vincenzo and Maria Grazia Cali. His father was a coal miner. After the family moved to New Jersey, Mr. Cali graduated from the Montclair Normal School, now Montclair State University, in 1936. He served as an Army intelligence officer in Europe during World War II.
        Besides his brother, Mr. Cali is survived by two daughters, Angela, of Montclair, and Joanne Prenner, of Southborough, Mass.; a son, John, of Mountain Lakes, N.J.; and five grandchildren. His wife of 63 years, Mary Grazia Cali, died in 2003.
