        Washington is watching closely to see whether President Bush will change much when he faces a new, Democratic Congress. But his character on ''Saturday Night Live'' already has. Previously played by Will Forte, Mr. Bush is now being played by Jason Sudeikis. Lorne Michaels, the NBC television show's executive producer, said that where Mr. Forte played Mr. Bush as whiny and beleaguered, Mr. Sudeikis, below, is playing him as having ''absolute confidence and buoyancy.'' But in a sign that the world is starting to look past Mr. Bush's tenure, Mr. Michaels said he was freeing up Mr. Forte to play a new political role eventually: that of one of the 2008 contenders.
