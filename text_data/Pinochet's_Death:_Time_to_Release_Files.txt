        Re ''Augusto Pinochet, 91, Dictator Who Ruled by Terror in Chile, Dies'' (front page, Dec. 11):
        Chileans and international human rights advocates have worked tirelessly to uncover exactly what happened during the Pinochet regime. Their efforts to declassify and preserve files from the Pinochet era have provided a strong foundation for consolidating democracy in Chile.
        The United States government contributed to this openness during the Clinton administration by declassifying more than 16,000 documents on Chile. But the United States withheld documents on the 1976 car bomb assassination of Orlando Letelier, a Chilean diplomat, and an American, Ronni Moffitt, in Washington because of a continuing investigation into General Pinochet's role in that terrorist crime.
        General Pinochet's death clearly ends that investigation.
        The United States should thus take care of this unfinished business and release the files on the assassinations. Doing so would be meaningful to the families of Augusto Pinochet's victims, who no longer have recourse to a trial, and would make a valuable contribution to Chilean historical memory.
