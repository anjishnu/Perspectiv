        ON the first day of December, Newport, R.I., kicked off its 36th Christmas in Newport season on a cold and soggy evening when at least the mulled cider was hot. The tree lighting in Washington Square, normally signaled by a cannon blast into the crisp night air, was triggered by a cellphone call from within the dry confines of the stately Colony House. Then, with the wheeze of a squeeze box, the music and the dancing began.
        Throughout Newport this holiday season, the essence of a picturesque and historic port city shines brightly. Throngs of summertime tourists have been swept away by chilly ocean breezes, and visitors can freely navigate cobblestone streets and appreciate the multifaceted heritage of a city with a remarkable number of restored Colonial buildings -- 500 in total.
        Newport cleaves into three areas, each one dressed with holiday trimmings. The neighborhoods of Historic Hill and the Point, where candles twinkle from the parlor windows of clapboard homes, form the town's Colonial core. Tracing along the harbor is Thames Street, where one can complete holiday shopping in boutiques and then rest weary feet and feed restless children at lively restaurants. And Bellevue Avenue, the elegant street of mansions built in Newport's Gilded Age at the end of the 19th century, furthers the holiday spirit with displays and concerts.
        Holiday Hoopla
        The Newport Gateway Visitors Center at 23 America's Cup Avenue (800-976-5122, www.gonewport.com), is a one-stop starting point. Load up there on information and purchase tickets to attractions all around town. This time of year, its parking lot is free on weekdays (there's an hourly fee on weekends). From there, you can hop onto a public trolley, brightly painted and trimmed out in Gilded Age green and gold ($6 per person for a Ripta All-Day Pass or $18 for a family or a foursome).
        For two and a half centuries, Bowen's Wharf (401-849-2120, www.bowenswharf.com) has been a central meeting place on Newport's waterfront, and it's a center for holiday celebrations today. The wharf's brightly lighted tree and decorated shops and restaurants will sparkle right through New Year's.
        A short stroll south is the Sovereign Bank Family Ice Skating Center at the Newport Yachting Center (401-846-3018, www.skatenewport.com). Sessions are $7 or $12 with skates rental for adults, and $5 or $9 with skates rental for ages 3 to 11.
        In Newport, Santa and Mrs. Claus get around. Tomorrow and Sunday, they'll ride the Santa Express, which departs from the train station at 19 America's Cup Avenue at 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. for a 90-minute excursion along Narragansett Bay. Admission is $14.95 for adults and $9.95 for ages 2 to 10; reservations are required (800-398-7427, www.newportdinnertrain.com).
        The evolution of holiday celebrations in Newport is detailed in the Holiday Lantern Walking Tour (401-846-0813, www.newporthistorical.org), held Tuesday and Thursday at 6:30 p.m. The cost is $12 for adults, and $8 for ages 8 to 18. The route begins at the Colony House, built in 1739, and passes taverns, homes and churches of note on Historic Hill. The tour stops at the Touro Synagogue at 85 Touro Street (401-847-4794, www.tourosynagogue.org), which was dedicated at Hanukkah time in 1763 and is believed to be the oldest place of Jewish worship in North America. The synagogue is open for tours on Sundays.
        The tour then pauses in the cemetery of Trinity Church (401-846-0660, www.trinitynewport.org), built in 1726 on Queen Anne Square. One of many notable parishioners was Clement Clarke Moore, who summered in Newport and is best remembered for his words '''Twas the Night Before Christmas.'' On Sundays, the church is open after the 10 a.m. service until 1 p.m. Our tour concluded back at the Colony House, where we were treated to fruited gingerbread made from a 19th century recipe.
        The tour is sponsored by the Newport Historical Society, which operates the Museum of Newport History at 127 Thames Street (401-841-8770, www.newporthistorical.org, admission by contribution) in the former Brick Market, built in 1762. Among the displays is the Ocean House Omnibus, a (stationary) trolley that you can hop aboard for a nine-minute video tour of life in Newport society in 1879.
        A Victorian Christmas Tour at the Astors' Beechwood Mansion at 580 Bellevue Avenue (401-846-3772, www.astorsbeechwood.com) offers a rich taste of that life. Here, actors in period costumes engage visitors in spontaneous conversation (circa 1891) in parlors, bedrooms and servants' quarters around the house. Children can assume snooty accents as they chat up members of the Astor family about yachting and cotillions among ''the 400'' families of the Social Register. At the sound of a bell, visitors gather for festivities in the gilded ballroom. Be prepared to dance a waltz or take part in a parlor game with your hosts. Admission is $18 for adults, $8 for ages 6 to 17, $45 for a family of two adults and two to four children. The tour is given up to five times daily, and a Victorian Christmas Feast will be held this evening ($100) and Sunday ( $90).
        The Preservation Society of Newport County offers a ''winter passport'' ($25 for adults, $9 for ages 6 to 17) to the Breakers, the Elms and Marble House, 3 of the 11 mansions under its auspices. All are trimmed with Christmas trees, presents and poinsettias. Some are hosts to holiday concerts (401-847-1000, www.newportmansions.org).
        Some Alternatives
        If you're slightly weary of all the ho-ho-ho'ing, breathe in some salty air on the Cliff Walk, a 3.5-mile coastal pathway. While waves crash just below the path, children can stick their noses through wrought-iron fences for backyard peeks at mansions.
        For a sense of 15-mile-long Aquidneck Island on which Newport rests, drive the 10-mile loop of Scenic Ocean Drive. There are stunning ocean views, jaw-dropping mansions and primo kite flying at the wind-swept Brenton Point State Park (401-847-2400). Old breeds of sheep, goats and Dutch belted cattle (they look like Oreos with hoofs) roam the grounds of a farm near Fort Adams State Park (401-847-2400). The fort, built in 1857, is closed for the winter, but you can climb over large cannons and enjoy views of the harbor.
        The Narragansett Bay on the Seal Watch Cruise ($20 for adults, $15 for ages 6 to 12 and seniors) departs from Bowen's Wharf on weekends all winter long. Over the rumble of the ship's engine, a guide explains how the harbor seals migrate there in winter in search of herring and lobsters. Binoculars are provided. The cruise is operated by Save the Bay (401-324-6020, www.savebay.org), which also has an Exploration Center and aquarium at Easton's Beach, and by the Rose Island Lighthouse Foundation (401-847-4242, www.roseisland.org).
        Where to Eat
        A red fire truck on the roof of the bright yellow Brick Alley Pub & Restaurant at 140 Thames Street (401-849-6334, www.brickalley.com) signals that fun will be had by all. You'll find creative burgers and pizzas ($8 to $12), along with seafood and tasty sides like garlic smashed potatoes ($4).
        The Black Pearl on Bannister's Wharf is known for its chowder ($7.25) and fresh seafood dishes ($23 to $26). Its wharf setting, just a seagull's hop from a working seafood market, is the right spot to teach kids how to slurp down oysters and clams (401-846-5264, www.blackpearlnewport.com). At the Red Parrot at 348 Thames Street (401-847-3800, www.redparrot.org), a 22-page menu hits a lot of Caribbean notes with Coco-'ribbean chicken ($7.95) and conch fritters ($6.95), and the sweet potato fries ($2.95) will have everyone's fingers in the plate. A kid's menu has chicken littles and miniature corn dogs ($5.95).
        Where to Stay
        Just for the holidays, the chefs at the Newport Marriott at 25 America's Cup Avenue (401-849-1000, www.newportmarriott.com) baked up a seven-foot gingerbread house and a 16-foot lighthouse for the lobby. The hotel has an indoor pool and a fitness center. Rooms are $145 to $199; holiday specials begin at $99.
        The Hotel Viking (1 Bellevue Avenue, 401-847-3300, www.hotelviking.com), high atop Historic Hill, has a 35-foot Christmas tree in the courtyard, an indoor pool, a fitness center and a spa. Rooms are $129 to $179.
        The Newport Hyatt Regency on Goat Island (401-851-1234, www.newport.hyatt.com) has sweeping views of the harbor and the town. It's a short drive or a windy stroll from town, and a shuttle bus runs every half-hour. There is an indoor pool, a fitness center and a spa. Rooms are $149 to $179; suites are $349 to $499.
