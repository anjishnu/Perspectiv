        Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, the chief American negotiator on North Korea's nuclear program, said North Korea's nuclear test in October had brought China and the United States closer together, with China now generating ''ideas of its own'' at six-nation talks under way in Beijing. ''The Chinese really want to get this done,'' he said as the second day of negotiations ended. He said the United States had held bilateral talks with the North Korean delegation. Financial officials from each country met to discuss banking restrictions that North Korea insists must be lifted before it will consider dismantling its nuclear weapons program.
