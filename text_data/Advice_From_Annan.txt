        Re ''Annan Urges U.S. to Reject Unilateralism in Diplomacy'' (news article, Dec. 12):
        The admonishment by Kofi Annan, the departing United Nations secretary general, that the United States can remain a leader in the global human rights movement only if the country remains ''true to its principles, including in the struggle against terrorism,'' will infuriate many Americans.
        Some will be angry that a foreigner dares lecture the United States about its own principles. The more thoughtful, however, will be ashamed that the lecture is necessary.
