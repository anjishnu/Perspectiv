        To the Sports Editor:
        I think Barry Bonds should consider retiring the moment he hits career home run No. 755, tying Hank Aaron. By sharing the record, he would most likely defuse much of the resentment he would garner by surpassing the feats of a class act like Aaron.
        He will still retain the honor of having hit the most home runs, and sportswriters and statisticians are likely to be more forgiving and less driven to affix an asterisk to his name if he merely ties the record.
        As Aaron and Bonds become the answer to the question, ''Who holds baseball's most prestigious record?'' both men can enjoy the cachet of holding it until Alex Rodriguez tops them in 10 or 12 years.
