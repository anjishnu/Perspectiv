        At the end of a road lined with freshly minted, oversize colonial-style homes surrounded by carefully tended lawns is a jarring sight: an unusual 1970s house with shredded strips of its tar roof and quartz-covered walls torn away and spread about the yard.
        In this stylish town where residents are waging what seems to be an all-out campaign to bolster its colonial image, teardowns are hardly an unusual sight. But many people are horrified that a Modernist home designed by a renowned architect is about to be razed.
        Since a local Web site began spreading that news last month, a debate has erupted about the character of Westport and the future of the house, which is on sought-after Minute Man Hill Road.
        It was designed by Paul Rudolph, who was the dean of the Yale School of Architecture from 1958 to 1965 and a student of the Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Mr. Rudolph, who died in 1997, built homes and public and commercial buildings. Among them are his penthouse apartment on Beekman Place in Manhattan, Yale's Art and Architecture Building and the Burroughs Wellcome headquarters in North Carolina.
        In an interview on the Web site, WestportNow.com, Morley Boyd, the chairman of the Westport Historic District Commission, said: ''If you're looking for shock value, it's hard to beat the loss of this house. There is not much to top it.''
        But in a town where 92 demolition permits have been issued so far this year, a celebrated lineage alone is not enough to save the house. Because it is not at least 60 years old, the historic commission does not have jurisdiction.
        ''The house is not historically significant, and any view of how good or bad an architect Paul Rudolph was is purely subjective,'' said David Waldman, who runs a commercial real estate company and whose wife is listed in town records as the buyer of the house.
        Mr. Waldman said that his family wanted the house for the lot. ''We have a family of three young children, and a modern structure wasn't appealing to us,'' he said.
        The 4,200-square-foot house, which is to be razed this week, was commissioned by Louis Micheels, a former president of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society, and his wife, Ina.
        It is an elongated series of interconnecting cubes, whose eastern end, the master bedroom suite, hovers above a sloping hillside. Thin panels on cantilevers hang above large windows, keeping the sun at bay. And typical of the experiments with new materials for which Mr. Rudolph was known, pieces of Arctic quartz are embedded in the exterior stucco, giving the off-white walls a rough-hewn texture.
        ''Its overlapping planes and spaces open up beautifully to each other,'' said Robert A. M. Stern, dean of Yale's architecture school. ''As with his other work of the time, Mr. Rudolph managed to synthesize the dynamism of Mies van der Rohe with the spatial inventiveness of our most famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.''
        The Micheelses recently moved to Newton, Mass., after living in the house for more than 30 years. ''We are getting pretty old and we wanted to be close to our children,'' said Dr. Micheels, 89, a Dutch-born Auschwitz survivor who wrote ''Doctor 117641: A Holocaust Memoir.''
        Still, they said they left with fond memories. The openness of its interior and the terraces facing Long Island Sound were favorite aspects of the house.
        ''We could see out to the Norwalk Islands, and you can't ask for more than that,'' Dr. Micheels said.
        In September 2005, he and his brokers began searching for a buyer who would appreciate the house's architectural merits and be willing to pay almost $5 million for it.
        But there were no offers, and the price was reduced by about $1 million. ''People are not interested in houses from the 1970s,'' said Marina Leo of the Higgins Group real estate agency, who was one of the brokers. Still, the recent outcry against tearing the home down reflects a feeling among many in Westport that they have lost an opportunity to preserve a significant building.
        As Professor Stern put it: ''All over the world people are waking up to the fact that Modernist houses are valuable works of art. The town of Westport will be diminished by this loss.''
