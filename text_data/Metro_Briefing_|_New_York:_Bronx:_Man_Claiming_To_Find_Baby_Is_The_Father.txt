        A man who said he had found a newborn boy in a Bronx park on Saturday later admitted that he was the boy's father, the police said. The man, whose name was not released, has not been charged with any crime, and the baby was in good physical condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, the police said. The man told the police he found the baby shortly after 1 p.m. on the ground near crossroads in the southern end of Crotona Park, the police said. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man was the baby's father, the police said. The boy's mother had given birth to him in their apartment and felt she was unable to care for the child, the police said. She asked the father to take the baby to a precinct or hospital, which he did, the police said.
