        A 34-year-old nanny who the police say smothered her newborn and dumped him in a garbage can at a train station on Long Island has been charged with second-degree murder.
        The woman, Emma Stephens, who lives in Brooklyn, was arrested on Thursday night after the police discovered a surveillance tape of her tossing the baby, a boy, into a trash can at the train station in Hicksville, N.Y., last month, the Nassau County police said. A commuter found the child in a box about 9:30 a.m. on Nov. 27.
        According to the police, Ms. Stephens worked as a live-in nanny at a home in Woodbury near the train station, where she looked after a 4-year-old.
        The police said yesterday that the baby had been born alive in Ms. Stephens's apartment in Brooklyn on Nov. 26, and that she had apparently smothered him, then put him in a shoebox. On her way to work the next day, she was seen on the tape throwing a plastic bag with the shoebox into a garbage can at the Hicksville station.
        The police said that the shoebox led them to a nearby shoe store, and that witnesses at the station helped them identify the woman on the tape.
        It was not clear last night what led Ms. Stephens to discard her baby, the police said. They said she had hidden the pregnancy from friends, relatives and the family she worked for, and that she may have been worried about having a child out of wedlock.
        A week after the baby's body was found, the Nassau County Police Department and the Children of Hope Foundation gained legal custody of it. They named the child Nicholas Hope, then gave the boy a funeral and burial.
