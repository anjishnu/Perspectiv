        The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday that Newark Liberty International Airport had set a record for the number of passengers who used the airport in a year. More than 34.2 million passengers have passed through the airport this year, the authority' chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, said in a statement. The previous record was set in 2000, when 34,188,701 passengers used the airport. The authority projected more growth, with estimates of 36 million passengers in 2007 and 40 million passengers in 2010.
