        The principal of Camden High School has been suspended with pay as part of a wider investigation of grade-fixing in the Camden School District, a district spokesman said yesterday. The principal, Al Davis, 58, was suspended after a special board meeting on Monday, ''pending the outcome of an investigation by the district administration,'' Bart Leff, a spokesman for the Camden Board of Education, said in a statement. Mr. Davis, a former N.F.L. running back, has been principal at Camden High School since 2004.
