        An Illinois company that has struggled since 1985 to create a safe and effective artificial blood substitute said yesterday that it had surmounted a major hurdle, but investors had their doubts, sending the shares down sharply in after-hours trading.
        The company, Northfield Laboratories, said that its oxygen-carrying solution, made from a blood component called hemoglobin, matched the performance of standard saline solutions in keeping accident and crime victims alive until they could get a blood transfusion in a hospital.
        It based the assertion on a preliminary analysis of the results from a controversial clinical trial in which hundreds of patients were treated without first giving their consent.
        ''We're certainly buoyed by the results,'' said Steven A. Gould, Northfield's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Gould said that the company hoped to be able to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration this winter and was still on schedule to submit its full application next market to market the product, called PolyHeme.
        But the hopeful results were based on a subset of patients that were treated exactly as specified in the trial, not all 722 patients enrolled in it. Northfield, based in Evanston, Ill., said the product failed to produce comparable safety results in the larger group.
        Northfield also said that it could not be sure yet that it achieved success in the properly treated group. The company discovered last week that the data delivered by the contractor who managed the test contained conflicting information on two deaths. Northfield said that the data on those deaths would be corrected and that both the research contractor and an independent third party would now verify all critical data before Northfield analyzes the results and submits them to federal regulators.
        Shares of Northfield fell $2.90, or 20.25 percent, to close at $11.42 in trading yesterday before the results were announced. They tumbled sharply in after-hours trading once the trial results were announced, falling as much as $5.86, more than 50 percent, to $5.56.
        The trial attracted criticism because regulators allowed Northfield Laboratories to test PolyHeme on trauma victims without their consent. Researchers said that freedom was necessary because nearly all trauma victims injured severely enough to need rapid transfusions were in no condition to provide consent.
        The criticism and the concerns about informed consent may have hurt a rival, Biopure, even more than Northfield. Northfield was allowed to complete its trial, which was well under way, despite requests that regulators halt it. But last week, a panel of experts recommended that the F.D.A. not allow a similar trial of Biopure's blood substitute that the United States Navy wanted the agency to let it sponsor.
        Biopure's product, which is made from purified cow's blood instead of human blood components, has been approved in the United States to treat anemia in dogs and for human transfusions in South Africa. But it failed to prove as safe as blood in orthopedic surgery.
        Biopure, based in Cambridge, Mass., traded as high as $288 (adjusting for splits) in early 2000 when investors thought it was in the lead to commercialize a blood substitute. It ended trading yesterday at 57 cents, up a penny. A number of other rivals have gone bankrupt. Some others, most notably Baxter International, dropped out of the competition after investing heavily, but start-ups continue to explore the field.
        Blood substitutes and saline solutions both keep blood pressure from falling to fatal levels in patients who are bleeding heavily. Northfield and other companies that have sought to develop blood substitutes have assumed that patients could get greater benefits from products that deliver oxygen as they preserve blood pressure. Unlike donated human blood, blood substitutes can be transfused without worrying about whether blood types have been matched, and can remain usable longer than human blood.
