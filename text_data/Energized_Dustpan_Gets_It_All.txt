        It's hard to imagine how a dustpan could be improved. But if you have been frustrated by that last line of dirt that is always left just outside a dustpan after sweeping, you will appreciate the new PowerPan by ReadiVac. The PowerPan is a dustpan with a built-in, battery-operated vacuum that picks up every last crumb with the push of a trigger on the dustpan's handle. It can be used with any brush, emptied by holding it upright over a wastebasket or by opening its back cover, and it hangs on a nail like other dustpans; $14.99 at target.com; for other stores and information, readivac.com or (800) 982-5233.
