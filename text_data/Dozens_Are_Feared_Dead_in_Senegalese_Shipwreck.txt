        Two dozen people were rescued and dozens more were feared dead after a boat carrying people trying to reach the Canary Islands was wrecked in northern Senegal on Saturday, officials said Sunday.
        The boat was the second carrying migrants to wash up in Senegal in the past week, representing a mere handful of the tens of thousands of people who have risked their lives in the rough seas off the coast, bent on reaching the Canary Islands and from there mainland Europe.
        On Wednesday, the wreckage of a migrant boat washed up in the fishing community of Yoff, near the capital, with 29 people on board. Every year hundreds of people, perhaps even thousands, die trying to reach Europe by sea.
        Senegalese officials told Reuters on Sunday that the boat that wrecked on Saturday had left Djifer, a fishing village in southern Senegal, two weeks ago, bound for Spain, but had turned back because of bad weather. It was unclear how many people were on board, and it is difficult to verify the number of people who die in boat accidents because accounts from survivors are often unreliable. The survivors of the crash were taken to hospitals in Saint-Louis, a coastal city in northern Senegal.
        The voyage by sea from Senegal to the Canaries is a perilous one, especially in the small wooden boats used by impoverished would-be migrants. The migrants pay fees, sometimes thousands of dollars, to brokers who find them passage on fishing boats. The boats are not designed for long journeys and often are forced to turn back by the huge Atlantic waves and storms at sea.
        About 25,000 Africans have arrived in the Canary Islands this year, many of them from Senegal, seeking jobs and an escape from the poverty of the arid Sahel region. The influx has prompted Spain to send senior officials to West Africa to negotiate joint patrols of the West African coastline and development aid to try to stem the flow of migrants.
