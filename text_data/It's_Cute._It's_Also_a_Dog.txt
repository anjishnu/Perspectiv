        To the Editor:
        I must admit -- I dress up my dogs. They've been to parties and have earned their fair share of frequent flier miles traveling in designer handbags. And while I can say proudly that they're quite fashionable, I've never mistaken them for fashion. That's why I winced when I read Ruth La Ferla's article ''Woman's Best Friend, or Accessory?'' (Dec. 7).
        As a dog owner first and pet expert second, I'm concerned about the cavalier attitude displayed by these pet owners. Ladies, your dog is not a Barbie doll. It needs training, daily exercise, appropriate diet and canine companionship.
        The ''nationwide trend toward smaller dogs'' mentioned in Ms. La Ferla's article is not without problems. Buyers' willingness to purchase these toy breeds from pet stores or backyard breeders supports irresponsible breeding.
        But most of us who own dogs appreciate them as more than just style accessories. It is the social aspect of dog ownership that makes these pets such a great fit for our way of life.
