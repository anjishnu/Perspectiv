        To the Editor:
        I am one of the students featured in your Dec. 8 front-page article ''Off to College on Their Own, Shadowed by Mental Illness'' (''Troubled Children'' series).
        I want to thank The Times for bringing the issue of mental illness, and especially transition issues, to the forefront.
        I agreed to be interviewed for this article about transition not for personal accolades but for the people out there who perpetuate the stigma of mental illness.
        Mental illness is misunderstood in modern America. If you saw someone break a bone, would you not help him or her? This is the problem with the view of mental illness by society in general. People think that it is less devastating and less important than physical illness because you cannot see it.
        This recalls the old aphorism, ''Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there.'' This is what the public needs to learn.
        What needs to be understood is this: Transition, as in any significant change in one's life, can be especially hard on someone with mental illness. But with the proper help and support, it can be managed.
