        Designtex, a company in Manhattan that designs textiles and wall coverings, has expanded its line of architectural panels in which fabrics and other materials are bound between sheets of resin. Among 38 new patterns are, from top, Kenya Rush, with a scattering of real reeds; Sapphire Rock Candy, with a random toss of broken blue glass; and Underwood, with fake leaves and branches.
        The panels, available in thicknesses from one-sixteenth inch to one inch, can be used for space dividers, cabinet doors or countertops.
        ''You wouldn't use it as a kitchen sink, because it's not heatproof,'' said Kristen Hamilton of Designtex. A 4-by-8-foot panel is $400 to $2,500, a 4-by-10-foot panel $650 to $4,000. The line is called Fusion. It is to the trade only; (800) 221-1540 or designtex.com.
