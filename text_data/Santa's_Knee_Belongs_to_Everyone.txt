        THE strollers were bumper-to-bumper last weekend, and the elves had to shout to be heard over the gabble of tiny voices. Santaland, as Macy's calls its Christmas attraction, is a kingdom of children.
        But there were exceptions: adults who, for reasons of curiosity or nostalgia, were standing in the two-hour line unencumbered by minors. Some were sheepish, others faintly defiant.
        Carolyn Weaver, 62, who was visiting from Baltimore with friends and combined the expedition with a trip to Radio City Music Hall, was among the defiant. ''I wouldn't bring no kids,'' she said. ''We've always come with five or six women.''
        Veterans of the Santa industry say that perhaps 20 percent of visits are adults-only groups. And what do they want for Christmas?
        ''The women, many of them want husbands,'' said one of Macy's Santas, who, following company policy, would be interviewed only in character. ''The men, many of them want cars. I say that Santa will do his very best to surprise them.''
        Some Santas seat visitors next to them, and some seat them atop a knee; it depends mostly on the size of the throne. Dick Shea, the longtime Santa Claus at the Manhattan Mall, falls into the second category. Adults, he reported, ''always say, 'Oh, I'm going to break your leg.' ''
        ''I've had some big people sit on me,'' he said. ''But you just brace it.''
