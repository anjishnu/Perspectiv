        No one has ever accused Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Democrat from Harlem, of being a friend of business. The United States Chamber of Commerce gives him a dismal 25 percent rating on his voting record.
        But what a difference an election makes. Now that Mr. Rangel, 76, is set to become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- which writes tax policy and oversees large entitlement programs -- business is starting to make nice.
        The Columbia Business School just said it would give him its Distinguished Leadership in Government award at a fund-raising dinner next May.
        Previous winners include the Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Alan Greenspan and former President George H. W. Bush.
        Another winner, in 1993, was Vice President Dick Cheney, a frequent vocal sparring partner of Mr. Rangel's. No word if he will show.
