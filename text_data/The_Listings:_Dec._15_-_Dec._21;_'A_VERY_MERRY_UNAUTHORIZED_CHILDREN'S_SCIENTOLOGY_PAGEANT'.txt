        This sweet show with hidden fangs delivers exactly what its title promises: an elementary-school-style entertainment, cast entirely with children, that explains the teachings of the Church of Scientology in the manner of a homespun Christmas pageant. The production is the work of Les Freres Corbusiers, a young troupe that has risen to prominence through its grasp of the premise that satire in these self-satirizing times requires almost no exaggeration, just a simple readjustment of context. (This is the company that built a literal-minded facsimile of a Hell House, an evangelical chamber of horrors, in the fashionable Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn for Halloween.) Conceived and directed by Alex Timbers, with a book and songs by Kyle Jarrow, ''Pageant'' presents the life and philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, as a tuneful journey that bears a strong resemblance to that of another messiah, from nativity to Gethsemane to apotheosis. What keeps the show from feeling insufferably arch is the earnestness of its very young ensemble members, who sing, dance and stumble over lines with that adorable amateurishness that makes grown-ups mist up even as they wince. Since it was first staged in New York three years ago, ''Pageant'' has acquired a shade more professional polish and an addition to its cast of guest celebrity characters (Katie Holmes, who appears as a sock puppet on the hand of the actor playing Tom Cruise). But its creators remain true to their savvy creed that nothing brings out irony like the appearance of innocence. (Through Jan. 7, 4th Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-239-6200, nytw.org; $32.)
