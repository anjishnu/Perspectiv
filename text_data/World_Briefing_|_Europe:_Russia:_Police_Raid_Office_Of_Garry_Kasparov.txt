        Counter-terrorist police officers raided the offices of a political organization headed by Garry Kasparov, left, the former world chess champion, and seized books and printed materials promoting a march on Saturday against President Vladimir V. Putin, according to news reports and Mr. Kasparov. No one was arrested and no charges were filed in the raid, which lasted more than an hour in the organization's Moscow headquarters. Mr. Kasparov, who retired from professional chess last year to form the organization, United Civil Front, said in a telephone interview that the search was unlawful. ''We're talking about the Putin regime destroying our country,'' he said, describing the content of the materials seized. ''Obviously it is unacceptable to this regime.''
