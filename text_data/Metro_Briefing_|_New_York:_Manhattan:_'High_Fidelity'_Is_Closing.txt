        The producers of ''High Fidelity,'' the Broadway musical based on the novel by Nick Hornby, announced last night that the show would end its run at the Imperial Theater on Sunday evening after 32 performances. The musical, which cost a reported $10 million, never drew significant advance sales in previews, and opened on Thursday to a raft of bad reviews.
