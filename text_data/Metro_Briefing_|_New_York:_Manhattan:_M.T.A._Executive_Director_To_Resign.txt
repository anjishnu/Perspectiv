        The executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Katherine N. Lapp, left, announced yesterday that she would resign at the end of the year to make way for new leadership at the agency under Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer. A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer said he would announce Ms. Lapp's successor today. Speculation has centered on Elliot G. Sander, a former city transportation commissioner.
