        Bob Barr, a former congressman from Georgia and one of Bill Clinton's most dogged pursuers during impeachment, said last week that he was leaving the Republican Party to become a ''card-carrying member of the Libertarian Party.'' Questions abound.
        Is there actually a card that card-carrying Libertarians carry? ''There actually is,'' Mr. Barr said in a brief phone interview. ''It's a heavy plastic card, the size of a credit card, with the party logo on it.''
        Does he carry the card? ''In my briefcase. And I always have my briefcase.''
        Is having a card at odds with Libertarianism? ''I'm not required to carry the card.''
        ''And it has no R.F. ID chips or biometric identifiers in it,'' he said, referring to radio frequency identification. ''If there were, I would immediately renounce my membership.''
