        Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into possible financial fraud by David A. Stockman, the former budget director in the Reagan White House, ABC News and The Associated Press said.
        Mr. Stockman became chief executive at Collins & Aikman, an auto parts maker in Troy, Mich., in 2003. He quit shortly before Collins & Aikman filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
        Investigators are looking into how the company accounted for millions of dollars in vendor rebates from 2002 to 2004. Collins said an internal review showed that it might have to reduce its earnings in that period by $10 million or more.
        Elkan Abramowitz, Mr. Stockman's lawyer, told The A.P. that his client had cooperated with the authorities and should not be charged.
        While still at the White House, of course, Mr. Stockman dismissed Reaganomics as a ''Trojan horse'' to allow large tax cuts for the rich. He later said the White House had summoned him to the ''woodshed'' for punishment.
