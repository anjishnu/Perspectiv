        SIMON--Bernard (Buzzy); left us on December 15th, 2006 at the age of 96. He will be remembered by his beloved wife, Frances (Hammerman), son Elliot and daughter-in-law Maxine (Fertel), granddaughters Marni Blake and Joy Simon and sister Anna Zavin. A simple gentle man, he leaves behind many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, nieces and nephews. We will all miss him.
