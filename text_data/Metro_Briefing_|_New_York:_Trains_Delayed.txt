        Dozens of Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains were delayed for up to an hour during the evening rush yesterday, railroad officials said, after communications equipment near Trenton failed. Electrical power was not interrupted, so trains continued to move at slower speeds while signals and switches were operated manually until fiber optic lines, which are used to direct the trains, were repaired around 7:15 p.m. Trains on the North Jersey Coast Line were also affected.
