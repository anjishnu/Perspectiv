        Stuart Miller writes that some fans say the ''jowly, paranoid'' Heat Miser was modeled on Richard M. Nixon. Actually, the veteran Mad magazine artist Paul Coker Jr. designed the Miser brothers to resemble the wonderful actors who provided their voices, George S. Irving and Dick Shawn. Mr. Coker also created caricatures of celebrity narrators like Jimmy Durante in other Rankin-Bass holiday specials. Then again, Mr. Irving had portrayed Nixon on Broadway in the 1972 production of ''An Evening With Richard Nixon and '' So maybe Mr. Miller is on to something after all.
