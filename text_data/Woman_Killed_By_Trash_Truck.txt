        A woman was killed and her friend seriously injured when they were hit by a garbage truck while they crossed a street in Midtown Manhattan late Friday night.
        The woman, Jessica Schmitz, 22, of Vero Beach, Fla., was pronounced dead at the scene. Her friend, Javier Herdina, 29, also from Florida, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was in stable condition yesterday.
        According to witnesses, the truck, which belonged to a private sanitation company, was moving at a slow to moderate speed when it turned left off Park Avenue South onto 30th Street, where Ms. Schmitz and Mr. Herdina were crossing shortly before midnight.
        ''The driver wasn't going too fast, he stopped right after he hit them just feet away from them,'' said Cory Sylvester, 23.
        The police did not release the name of the driver and said there was ''no criminality.'' Mr. Sylvester said that a police officer parked nearby responded immediately and that several witnesses called 911, but that Ms. Schmitz had been caught under the truck's wheels.
        He said that Mr. Herdina was conscious but bleeding heavily. ''I asked him where it hurt and he said everywhere,'' he said.
        A co-worker of Mr. Herdina who visited him at the hospital said that Mr. Herdina is a commercial airline pilot and that his work frequently brought him to New York. He said Ms. Schmitz was a friend who traveled with him to visit the city.
        Correction:  December 22, 2006, Friday  An article on Sunday about a traffic accident in Manhattan in which two pedestrians from Florida were struck by a garbage truck, one fatally, misspelled the survivor's surname. He is Javier Heredia, not Herdina.
