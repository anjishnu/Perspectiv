        Workers at a Newark garbage transfer station found the dismembered remains of an infant girl Monday morning, the Essex County prosecutor's office said yesterday. The medical examiner said the girl was probably Hispanic and no older than 6 months. The prosecutor, Paula T. Dow, said that the remains were discovered around 1 a.m. at the Newark transfer station on Frelinghuysen Avenue and that it was unclear if the girl had died before being left at the station. County and city investigators, along with members of the state police missing person's unit, are trying to determine the identity of the baby's parents.
