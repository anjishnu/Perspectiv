        Four men forced their way into the home of Senator Pete V. Domenici's daughter on Friday, leading the family's nanny to flee the house with the senator's 3-year-old granddaughter while leaving a 1-year-old grandson sleeping upstairs, the authorities said.
        A SWAT team and Capitol Police officers arrived at the home in Silver Spring, Md., shortly after the incident was reported Friday morning, according to the office of Mr. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico.
        The 42-year-old nanny was at home with the two children when she heard sounds at the front door, according to the Montgomery County police. When she opened the door, one of the men grabbed her while the other three forced their way into the house, which is in the Forest Glen section of Silver Spring, a northern suburb of Washington.
        The nanny, whose name was not released, pulled free from the assailant and fled the house with the 3-year-old, one of Mr. Domenici's 17 grandchildren.
        The burglars were dressed in black and wearing masks, the nanny told officers. She received minor bruises; the children were not harmed, the police said. It was unknown if anything was taken from the home or if the intruders were carrying weapons.
        Helen Domenici, the senator's daughter, was at work at the time of the break-in, said Matt Letourneau, a spokesman for Mr. Domenici. She called her father, who alerted the Senate sergeant-at-arms; the Capitol Police were dispatched to the home to assist local police at the scene.
        ''We're just glad this didn't turn into anything more serious,'' Mr. Letourneau said, adding that he did not believe the incident was related to Mr. Domenici's position.
