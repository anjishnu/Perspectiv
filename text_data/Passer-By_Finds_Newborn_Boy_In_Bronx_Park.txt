        A newborn boy, squirming in a blanket with his umbilical cord still attached, was found in a Bronx park yesterday, the police said.
        The infant, believed to be just hours old, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was in stable condition, the police said. The mother was being sought. A passer-by called 911 after spotting the child shortly after 1 p.m., on the ground near crossroads in the southern end of Crotona Park, the police said.
        The newborn was the third found abandoned or discarded in the New York metropolitan region in less than three weeks.
        On Tuesday, a newborn girl was found dead in the Bronx, face down on a patch of grass. Her 14-year-old mother, Letteschia Binns, was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, the police said. She is accused of throwing the baby out the window of her fifth-floor apartment.
        On Nov. 27, a commuter discovered a newborn boy's body in a shoebox at a Long Island train station. A surveillance camera took images of the baby's mother tossing the body, in the box, into a garbage can, the police said. The mother, Emma Stephens, a 34-year-old nanny, was charged with second-degree murder. The police said Ms. Stephens had hidden her pregnancy and smothered the boy shortly after his birth.
        The abandonment of the newborn boy yesterday defied New York's safe haven law, which allows people to leave newborns in safe places without facing criminal penalties.
        ''There's no reason for newborns to be left to the elements and possible death,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. ''The law provides that a parent or another person may anonymously leave newborns at a police station, firehouse or hospital where we know they will get life-saving attention.''
