        San Francisco 49ers (5-8)  at Seattle Seahawks (8-5)  8 p.m. Eastern, NFL Network
        Despite occasional sleepy spells and injuries to key offensive players, the Seahawks can clinch their third consecutive National Football Conference West title by winning tonight. Seattle leads the division by three games, with three games to go.
        Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and tailback Shaun Alexander are playing again after injuries, although Alexander does not seem to be at his best. But the Seahawks have lost receiver Darrell Jackson for at least this week with turf toe.
        In losing last Sunday to the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks were sloppy, with three lost fumbles. Their normally good defense could not contain the rookie quarterback Matt Leinart. As defensive end Bryce Fisher of the Seahawks said: ''You play a young quarterback and it's very simple. If you knock him down, he'll find a way to lose. If you don't knock him down, he'll look like he's on his way to the Pro Bowl.''
        After winning three in a row, the 49ers have lost three consecutive games. In the latest loss, to the Packers, the 49ers could not stop Brett Favre.
        ''We are a young football team, and that's a sign of our youth,'' 49ers Coach Mike Nolan said. Wide receiver Antonio Bryant was less generous, saying, ''I don't think our energy was there.''
