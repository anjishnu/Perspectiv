        A couple accused of spying for Cuba for more than 25 years pleaded guilty to federal charges after reaching a plea deal. The husband, Carlos Alvarez, a former associate professor of psychology at Florida International University, and his wife, Elsa Alvarez, a social worker at the university, were arrested in January on charges of spying on Cuban-American exile groups and informing Cuba without registering as foreign agents. Mr. Alvarez, 61, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to become an unregistered foreign agent and faces up to five years in prison. Mrs. Alvarez, 56, admitted concealing her husband's criminal activities and could serve up to three years in prison.
