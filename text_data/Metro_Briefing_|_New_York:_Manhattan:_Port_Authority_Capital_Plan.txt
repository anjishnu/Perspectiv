        The board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is scheduled to vote today on a 10-year capital plan that calls for $26 billion in investments by 2016. More than one-third of that money is allocated to required projects like the upkeep of the region's tunnels and bridges. The authority and other agencies also plan to spend $8 billion at the World Trade Center site. It has committed $2 billion for a tunnel under the Hudson River to be used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit, and $2 billion for regional transportation programs that could include construction of a Second Avenue subway, an extension of the No. 7 subway line and a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.
