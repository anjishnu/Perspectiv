        The OPEC oil cartel said yesterday that it planned to reduce its output by nearly 2 percent in February, the group's second production cut in two months and its strongest indication yet that it would seek to keep oil prices above $60 a barrel next year.
        Representatives from OPEC nations agreed to pare their production to 25.8 million barrels a day, from 26.3 million barrels, starting on Feb. 1. The group had already agreed to a 4 percent production cut in October to prop up prices.
        ''I hope the market appreciates we are working so diligently to bring supply and demand in balance, to have inventories at a reasonable level so that we do not have gyrations,'' Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, told reporters at the meeting in Abuja, Nigeria.
        The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which accounts for 40 percent of the world's oil exports, also said Angola would join the group next year, becoming its first new member since 1975.
        Angola, Africa's fastest-growing oil exporter, is a powerful addition to OPEC, which has 11 members. Foreign oil companies have invested heavily in Angola in recent years and expect its production to grow sharply in the coming decade. Angola pumps 1.4 million barrels a day, ranking it above Qatar and Indonesia within OPEC.
        Some OPEC producers have expressed concern that shrinking demand next year might cause prices to fall if production were left unchecked. But with oil prices still hovering around $60 a barrel and commercial inventories down substantially over the last months, analysts were surprised by OPEC's decision.
        ''This makes an incredibly tight market even tighter,'' said Edward Morse, the chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ''It's a very aggressive, assertive move. Clearly, some OPEC members want to keep a $60 floor.''
        Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose after the announcement by OPEC. Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.14, to $62.51 a barrel yesterday. Prices had lost more than $20 a barrel since hitting a record close of $77.03 this summer. That fall prompted OPEC to abandon its two-year- old policy of keeping its taps open to keep markets well supplied.
        After touching a low for the year of $55 in November, prices have since rebounded, mostly as OPEC has curbed supplies.
        ''They are jawboning the market and trying to show they are being aggressive,'' said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consultant in Washington. ''The question is, Are they being too aggressive?''
        In a statement released at the end of the one-day meeting, OPEC said that ''market fundamentals clearly indicate that there is more than ample crude supply, high stock levels and increasing spare capacity.''
        Saudi Arabia, the main power broker within OPEC and the world's biggest oil exporter, has taken the lead in reducing its own output and is behind the cartel's recent shift to curb supplies. Though some critics have been skeptical about past compliance, the Saudi minister estimated that OPEC members have adhered to about 80 percent of the cuts agreed upon at the last emergency meeting, held in Doha, Qatar, on Oct. 19.
        But since OPEC does not publish production figures, there is very little reliable data for oil markets. Mr. Morse of Lehman estimates that OPEC countries have actually pared production by only 700,000 barrels a day, instead of 1.2 million barrels, since the October meeting. He expects OPEC will cut only another 300,000 barrels, starting in February, instead of 500,000 barrels as agreed to yesterday.
        According to the latest report from the International Energy Agency, OPEC production fell by 550,000 barrels a day in November, to 28.9 million. That figure includes the production of Iraq, which does not have an OPEC quota.
        Analysts at the energy agency, which represents consumers, have warned OPEC not to cut its production further as higher energy prices could erode economic growth. The agency trimmed its forecast for Chinese demand growth to 5.6 percent in 2006, from a previous estimate of 6.2 percent.
        OPEC said yesterday in a statement that it expected global oil demand to grow by 1.3 million barrels a day in 2007. But it expects new supplies from non-OPEC producers to grow by 1.8 million barrels a day. This would be the largest one-year rise in non-OPEC supplies since 1984, according to OPEC.
        In the lead-up to the meeting, Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC president for this year, said there was a general support for a production cut. The representatives of Algeria, Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia all agreed about a need to trim production. In recent weeks oil inventories held by consuming nations fell sharply. In the United States, the world's biggest market, oil product stocks have fallen by 54 million barrels since October, a drop of nearly a million barrels a day.
        Lawrence J. Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, said OPEC ministers should be careful how they manage the market in coming months.
        He suggested that high energy costs could reduce consumption.
        ''That's a trend OPEC and the Saudis should not be ignoring,'' he said, ''because at the end of the day they want to sell, and if you want to sell, you need a vibrant economy, particularly in the United States.''
