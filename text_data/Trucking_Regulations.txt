        Re ''As Trucking Rules Are Eased, a Debate on Safety Intensifies'' (''Loosening the Rules'' series, front page, Dec. 3):
        The fact that the truck fatality rate has declined significantly over time is relegated to a single sentence in the 10th paragraph of a 3,300-word article.
        On the Bush administration's watch, it has declined 4 percent, and we strengthened the hours-of-service rule for the first time since 1939, requiring drivers to take a mandatory 10-hour break between shifts, up from eight in the previous rule. In fact, these efforts have been met with legal challenges from the trucking industry, a fact not included in your article.
        Though not mentioned, it is important to note that both my predecessor and I are former state police officers with long public safety careers, not trucking lobbyists.
