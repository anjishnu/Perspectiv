        GLAZER--Zelda, Wife, mother, teacher. Zelda Glazer was beautiful, poetic, funny. She loved her family, her friends, her world. She loved books and music, liberal politics and the view of Biscayne Bay from her balcony. Zelda loved to sing around her kitchen. She was fair and good and had a wicked sense of humor. She wore high heels, stylish dresses and, when she was younger, her black hair pulled tight in a bun. Her smile was like the sun. If she loved you, and she always did, you were better, you were blessed. Zelda was a high school English teacher, a vice-principal, and finally, the director of language arts for the entire Miami-Dade school system. In 1971 she was voted ''teacher of the year'' for the state of Florida. The University of Miami created the Zelda Glazer Writing Institute in 1986 so Zelda and her staff could inspire and educate teachers. It continues today. Zelda Glazer, 81, was killed instantly by a woman running a red light. Zelda was on her way to dinner with her husband of sixty years and her best friends. She was probably telling a story or listening to one. She was probably holding her husband's hand. She was happy. We will miss her forever. Zelda Glazer is survived by her husband Leonard, son Mitch, daughter Amy, son-inlaw James Connolly, daughter-in-law Kelly Lynch and grandchildren Liam Connolly and Shane Lynch.
