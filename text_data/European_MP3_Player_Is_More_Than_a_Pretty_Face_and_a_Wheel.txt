        In the world of MP3 players, there's the iPod and then there's everything else. The TrekStor Vibez is a player that stands out even among the dozens of ''everything elses'' on the market.
        The German-designed Vibez plays MP3 and Windows Media files and displays cover art and photos on its 1.25-inch-by-1-inch screen. The eight-gigabyte version ($170) holds about 2,000 songs; the 12-gigabyte model ($200) holds about 3,000.
        What separates the Vibez from the rest of the pack are its clean lines and unusual scroll wheel. The front of the player is clad in rubberized plastic, while the back is chromed metal. The wheel actually spins, unlike the touch-sensitive version on recent iPod models, and it has a lighted marker that increases in brightness as it approaches the four cardinal points.
        The Vibez generates playlists based on variables like the number of times played, and has a ''cover version'' feature that finds songs re-recorded by other artists.
        Originally sold in Europe, the Vibez is now available in the United States from online retailers and at J&R Music and Computer World in Lower Manhattan. While it won't knock the iPod off its pedestal, the streamlined Vibez might just be the belle of the ball.
