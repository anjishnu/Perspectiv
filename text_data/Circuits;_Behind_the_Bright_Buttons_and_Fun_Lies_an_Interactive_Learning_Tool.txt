        Most interactive DVD systems for children feel about as interactive as a vending machine. The ZOOOOS Play and Learn DVD System is an exception. Created for preschoolers by the same team that worked on the TiVo interface, the ZOOOOS Play and Learn DVD System consists of a boomerang-shaped infrared remote control with four brightly colored buttons. As with other specialized remotes, there's a one-time task of entering a code to match your brand of DVD player.
        ZOOOOS works with six DVDs, and two of them are included in a $30 starter kit available at www.funrise.com. Other titles ($15 each) feature Spider-Man and Thomas the Tank Engine. In one game, children explore numbers, pressing a button to show the numeral scratched in the sand or read in Spanish. Another disc mixes clips of animals from the San Diego Zoo with animal facts.
        The inventor of the system, Billy Pittard, came up with the eight-button remote after wrestling with awkward DVD controllers with 50 or more buttons. ZOOOOS, pronounced like the Greek god, tries to make a DVD player act more like a computer -- itself a task of mythical proportions.
