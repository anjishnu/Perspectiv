        To the Editor: ''In Missions of a Lost Utopia'' (Dec. 3), Larry Rohter omitted one of the most important Jesuit missionary settlements of the New World. Contrary to the ruins of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, there are seven magnificent Jesuit churches -- still standing -- in Bolivia, in what is called the Chiquitos Province, or Chiquitania. In 1990 Unesco designated six of them as monuments of the cultural heritage of mankind.
        Some of these churches were renovated, starting in the 1970s, by the Swiss architect Hans Roth, who remained in the area, working on the structures, until his death in 1999. During the renovations, archives of Baroque musical compositions were recovered. The richness of the music, which was composed and performed at the missions, has provided some of the inspiration for the International Festival of American Baroque Music, or Misiones de Chiquitos, which currently takes place every two years in the area.
