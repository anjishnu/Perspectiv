        The board of trustees for the state university system announced earlier this month that tuition and fees at the system's four colleges -- Central, Eastern, Southern and Western Connecticut State Universities -- would increase over the next two years.
        State residents will pay 6.3 percent more in each of the next two years, while out-of-state students, who make up 7 percent of the system's population, will pay 5.7 percent more.
        For state residents, the average tuition and fees, $14,278 this year, will rise to $15,189 next year and to $16,158 in 2008-9.
        In approving the increases, the trustees cited rising energy costs, increasing benefits for faculty and declining state financing.
        Christopher M. Brine, 21, the student government president at Central Connecticut State, said students were frustrated by the increases.
        ''I know of very few students who aren't working already to pay off their tuition, and this is going to hinder that process and lead to more debt when they get out of school,'' said Mr. Brine, a senior from Plainfield.
