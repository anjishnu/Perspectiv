        Yul Kwon, below, a 31-year-old consultant from California, became the 13th ''Survivor'' champion on Sunday, as the two-hour conclusion of the ''Cook Islands'' edition, which garnered headlines for forming teams along racial lines, made CBS No. 1 in the ratings for the night. But the 8 p.m. finale, which attracted 16.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates, was down 8 percent from last spring's ''Survivor: Panama'' finale and down 26 percent from last fall's ''Survivor: Guatemala'' finale. Among adults 18 to 49, Fox finished in second place for the night, just ahead of NBC, whose ''Sunday Night Football'' coverage of the Kansas City Chiefs and San Diego Chargers game drew roughly 13 million viewers. Aided by an overrun of Fox's afternoon football coverage, its comedy line-up of ''The Simpsons'' at 8 (9 million), ''American Dad'' at 8:30 (7.5 million), ''Family Guy'' at 9 (8.8 million) and a ''Family Guy'' repeat at 9:30 (7.8 million) won each half hour among adults 18 to 34. ABC ranked second for the night in total viewers. Its broadcast of the Tim Allen movie ''The Santa Clause 2,'' averaged 13.6 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m.
