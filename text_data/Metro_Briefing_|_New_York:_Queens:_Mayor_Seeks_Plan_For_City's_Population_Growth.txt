        Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced an elaborate campaign yesterday to engage the public in devising an environmentally sound plan to address the city's growing population and aging infrastructure through 2030. Mr. Bloomberg made the announcement at the Queens Museum of Art accompanied by videos and images of himself in a plaid bathrobe making toast and drinking coffee to illustrate the many systems, like water and electricity, that the average New Yorker taps into daily. Mr. Bloomberg said the city would seek ideas to meet 10 main goals, including housing for almost a million people, more mass transit and the cleanup of contaminated land.
