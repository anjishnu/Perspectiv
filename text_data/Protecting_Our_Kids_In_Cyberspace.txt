        Re ''Web Site Hunts Pedophiles, and TV Goes Along'' (front page, Dec. 13):
        The larger issue raised by your article is a societal reluctance to acknowledge the prevalence of sexual predators. From the sense by many individuals that sting operations entrap people, to the light sentences often imposed on those caught in stings, we can only conclude that we hold some fundamental inability to accept outwardly inoffensive-appearing men as predators.
        And why should this be? Most likely it is a feeling that there cannot possibly be so many men who want to have sex with minors; therefore they are being lured into saying things that they really don't mean in the unreal world of cyberspace. And yet the facts show the opposite to be the unfortunate truth.
        The underreporting of sexual abuse is well documented. Thus, to best protect children, we need to dispel our lingering doubts about the dangers pedophiles pose to children in cyberspace. Making the Internet safe requires concerted efforts by all concerned adults.
        We should continue to build partnerships between law enforcement and private groups, such as Perverted Justice, an antipedophile group, to ensure proper training and guidance in conducting sting operations. Such partnerships will best balance the rights of the defendants with the need to protect children.
