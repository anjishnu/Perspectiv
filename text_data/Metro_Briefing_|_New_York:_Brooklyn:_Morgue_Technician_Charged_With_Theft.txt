        A mortuary technician in the city medical examiner's office was charged yesterday with stealing money from a dead man's bank account, the City Department of Investigation said. The technician, Phillip Bethune, 38, of Brooklyn, was charged with grand larceny and official misconduct. Investigators said Mr. Bethune was sent to retrieve a body from a Brooklyn home last month and take it to the Brooklyn morgue. While doing so, investigators said, he took the man's bank card and its personal identification number. Over the next three days, investigators charged, Mr. Bethune used the card to take roughly $3,000 from the man's account.
