        The allure of a ''spy system . . . that can quickly assemble disparate pieces that are already lying around'' is so very American and so very wrong (Clive Thompson, Dec. 3). America has always been conflicted over the role of classic espionage. Thus, the idea of discerning high-value intelligence from behind a desk in Washington (by harvesting open sources of information and sharing this data via wiki or blog technology) has real appeal. In fact, it is no substitute for human and technical penetrations of our enemies. Sept. 11 was not simply the result of a failure to share intelligence or employ the latest data-analysis tool. It was the result of not having sufficient intelligence penetrations of Al Qaeda. A well-placed source is more efficient, more reliable and more useful than a million disparate pieces of information.
