        After criticism from civic leaders and residents, the Coast Guard announced on Monday that it had withdrawn its plan to create 34 zones for gunfire training on the Great Lakes, calling the proposal unsatisfactory.
        The Coast Guard had proposed using 34 offshore sites, about 70 square miles each, in the Great Lakes as shooting zones where they could test M-240B machine guns in exercises to prepare for terrorist threats.
        Months of meetings with community leaders and 900 or so public comments led to scrapping the proposal, said a spokesman, Lt. Greg Fondran of the Ninth Coast Guard District in Cleveland.
        Officials said that the need for such training remained and that the Coast Guard planned to revisit the question with some modifications, though there is no precise timetable for doing so.
        ''I will take the time to get this right,'' Rear Adm. John E. Crowley Jr., the commander of Coast Guard forces in the Great Lakes, said in a statement.
        ''I intend to reconsider the number, frequency of use and location of water training areas, as well as other concerns raised by the public,'' the statement said.
        A primary concern of the plan's detractors was the use of lead ammunition in the lakes. Admiral Crowley said he intended to pursue ''environmentally friendly alternatives to the lead ammunition we currently use.''
