        Several senior executives at AOL have resigned since the hiring of a new chief executive at the Internet company owned by Time Warner.
        Among those leaving by the end of the year are James P. Bankoff, executive vice president for programming and products, and Joe Redling, president for AOL mobile, customer management and paid services. The departures are part of an expected shuffle of executive positions by the new chairman and chief executive, Randy Falco. The internal reorganization is expected to be announced on Monday.
        Mr. Falco, a longtime executive at NBC Universal, was named last month to succeed Jonathan F. Miller as the head of the Time Warner unit that has undergone change and turmoil in recent years.
        The company is in the midst of a major strategy shift away from paid subscriptions for Internet hookups in favor of free Web services for broadband users. Last week, AOL laid off 450 employees under a previously announced restructuring plan.
