        Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced yesterday that New Jersey would offer $7 million worth of grants for embryonic stem cell research, and $3 million for the less controversial area of adult stem-cell research. The grants, which double the amount given during last year's first-ever round of grants, are intended to augment the state's attempt to become one of the leading laboratories for such research, which supporters hope can eventually help find cures for diseases like Parkinson's, pediatric AIDS and sickle cell anemia.
