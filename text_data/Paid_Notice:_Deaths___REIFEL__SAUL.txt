        REIFEL--Saul of New City, NY, formerly of Brooklyn, NY passed away on December 19, 2006. His angels, daughter, Toni, and mothers, Belle and Adele, were there to greet him. Born February 7, 1942 to Belle and Arthur Reifel and sister Marilyn, he loved his family, friends and the Brooklyn Dodgers. A few of his favorite activities were baseball, stickball, stoopball, handball and pitching pennies. Just another Brooklyn kid. Saul graduated from the Brooklyn Public School System. He followed his family tradition and joined the Local Pressman's Union. Saul began working for The Daily Mirror in the pressroom. After The Mirror stopped printing, he worked with friends at The New York Times. He continued his career as a pressman and was gradually promoted to a Foreman position. Ultimately, he gave 43 years of service to the New York Times. Saul is survived by his wife and soulmate, Marlene; sister, Marilyn; father-in-law, Anthony; children, Barbra, Sharon and Steven; their spouses, Michael and Ray; grandchildren, Michael, Gerald and Raymond; Godson Brett and his wife and children, Michelle, Ross and Jordyn; Uncle Sonny, Aunt Aileen and family; cousins Herb, David, Susan, Seymore, Leona. Saul was warm and friendly and people are proud to say they were his friends. He gave of himself selflessly and maybe complained a little but those who knew him, knew it was always in fun. He was called Grandpa by his grandsons and by the neighborhood kids that wanted to know if Grandpa would come out and play ball. He was a Dad to all his kids' friends that had lost their own dads. He will be missed by each and every heart he touched. Services will be today at 11:00 am at Hellman Memorial Chapels Funeral Home, 15 State Street, Spring Valley, NY 10977, (845) 356-8600. Please call for directions.
