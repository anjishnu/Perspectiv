        Dallas Cowboys (8-5) at Atlanta Falcons (7-6)  8 p.m.
        This game has huge playoff implications, especially for the Falcons.
        The Cowboys, even after being blown out by the New Orleans Saints on Sunday night, lead the National Football Conference East by a game. Atlanta is among 12 teams in the N.F.L. with records of 7-6 or 6-7. That would probably get the Falcons nowhere in the American Football Conference, but any N.F.C. team that wins the rest of its games seems likely to make the playoffs.
        The Saints scored 42 points against the Cowboys and could have easily had more. Dallas gave up 536 net yards (Drew Brees passed for 384).
        ''I don't think we are really as bad as what happened,'' Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said. ''This game is a humbling game. This could happen to anybody. There are a lot of people who would like to be in our position right this minute.''
        In a five-play stretch in a victory against Tampa Bay on Sunday, the Falcons lost tailbacks Warrick Dunn (calf) and Jerious Norwood (knee). Fullback Justin Griffith filled in well. Dunn and Norwood are listed as questionable.
        If the Falcons win, quarterback Michael Vick sees a clear future. ''We get that win, we get ourselves back into playoff contention, and we'll take it from there,'' he said.
