        Chess clubs are not on the endangered species list yet, but they are dwindling, another victim of the Internet. The United States Chess Federation now has 1,333 club affiliates, down from 2,232 10 years ago.
        Finding an opponent any time obviously has its advantages, but there is no substitute for playing face to face. Among the clubs that continue to thrive is the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan. Named after Frank J. Marshall, United States champion from 1909 to 1936, the club is one of the nation's oldest and strongest.
        Its annual championship, which ended last Sunday, was won by Jaan Ehlvest, a grandmaster originally from Estonia. Tied for second were Alexander Ivanov, a grandmaster originally from Russia, and Justin Sarkar, an international master who grew up in New York City.
        Sarkar's result gave him his first grandmaster norm. Three are needed for the grandmaster title.
        The critical game was Sarkar's eighth-round clash with Irina Krush, another international master, who lives in Brooklyn. The game was a topsy-turvy affair, with Krush often holding the upper hand, only to blunder at the end in a drawn position.
        The opening was a Nimzo-Indian Defense in which Krush played 4 f3. The idea is to buttress the center and try to take control of e4.
        Although it is not too uncommon, Sarkar's retreat of his bishop with 5  Be7 allowed Krush to play e4 without a hitch. With 7  e5, he immediately counterattacked the White center, and after 8 d5 Bc5, Black's bishop had found a useful diagonal.
        The problem with Black's setup was that it ceded White a lot of space. For a while, Krush put that advantage to good use.
        Krush missed a chance to apply more pressure. Instead of retreating her knight with 24 Nc3, she could have tried 24 Qg4, when after 24  cb 25 cb Rb6 26 Bb3 ab 27 Rc1 Qb8 28 Qd7 Rd6 29 Qf5 Bb6 30 Bb6 Rb6 31 Rb3, Black is down a pawn.
        Krush missed her last good chance by playing 35 d7. Instead, 35 Ne2 would force 35  Bc5, when 36 d7 Ra8 37 Rf5 Bd6 38 Nc3 Rd8 39 Na4 creates a similar position, but Sarkar's bishop would be more passive.
        After the rooks were traded, Sarkar's well-placed bishop largely made up for his deficit of one pawn. The king-and-pawn ending should have been a draw, but Krush erred badly, playing 47 a4 instead of 47 b4.
        ''I just lost my mind,'' she said in an interview. ''There is really no other way to explain my moves.''
