        To the Editor:
        It took quite a bit more than ''cocktail chatter'' to bring about Mr. Mamet's adaptation of ''The Voysey Inheritance.'' The American Conservatory Theater of San Francisco and Kansas City Repertory Theater commissioned the new version for a co-production, seen in those cities last year. Peter Altman, the retiring artistic director in Kansas City, and Carey Perloff, artistic director in San Francisco, were instrumental in this process, which led to a superb premiere production.
