        LEVINE--Michael, died peacefully after a long illness on December 11, 2006. He was 59 years old. At his side were his siblings Lynne Jacobs and Stuart Levine and their spouses James Jacobs and Louise Levine. A man of big passions and fiery intellect, Michael continued to live his life to its fullest up until his last days. Although he was confined to his bed, his smile and his personality permeated the hospital atmosphere, infecting both his visitors and the kind Morristown Memorial Hospital staff with his love for life and for family. Friends and relatives said goodbye to Michael the following day at a graveside service in New Montefiore Cemetery on Long Island. Taken from us too soon, Michael has left a gaping absence in our lives, but in passing he reminds us of the value of the life and family he leaves behind.
