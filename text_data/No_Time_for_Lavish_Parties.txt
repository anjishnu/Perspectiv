        To the Editor:
        The article on holiday parties once again made me so ashamed of my culture and my country. People are dying by the hundreds in Iraq. We have been asked to sacrifice precisely nothing in that effort. On the contrary, we seem to be ignoring it altogether.
        Who are these people who think it is appropriate to spend so much money on lavish parties? Shame on them, and shame on all of us for remaining silent.
