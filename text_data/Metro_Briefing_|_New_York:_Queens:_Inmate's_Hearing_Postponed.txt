        A hearing to review the claim of a man who said he was wrongly convicted of a 1992 murder was postponed yesterday. The man, Joshua Rivera, 36, had been prepared to drop his claim of innocence, said his mother, Gloria Rojas, because the Queens district attorney's office had offered to cut 24 years from his 37-year murder sentence if he entered a special form of guilty plea that did not require him to actually admit to the crime. After the hearing in State Supreme Court was adjourned for a week without explanation, both Mr. Rivera's lawyer, Christopher Renfroe, and an assistant district attorney, Daniel A. Saunders, declined to discuss the case. Mr. Rivera has led prosecutors to two witnesses who say they were in a car with the real killer, and that Mr. Rivera had no hand in the murder.
