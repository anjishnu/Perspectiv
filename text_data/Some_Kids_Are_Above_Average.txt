        Re: ''The Secret of Great Bread: Let Time Do the Work'' (The Minimalist, Nov. 8):
        The article stated that Jim Lahey's no-knead bread could be made by a 4-year-old; then the author settled on an 8-year-old as capable of making it.
        I decided to heed the author's advice, and I have gone through 872 8-year-olds (all of whom are weeping outside my house). All have dough clinging to various part of their bodies; some are stuck to the towels that one is supposed to place the bread on.
        Irate parents are calling me night and day questioning why I would impose such torture on innocent young minds. I have completely run out of 8-year-olds, and the town council has barred me from speaking to children either younger or older.
        The bread is wonderful, the technique exquisite, but the 8-year-olds in my town do not seem to possess the ability of the children in Mr. Lahey's town.
