        Really Cool Parrot
        Hard as it may be to believe, there was a time (say, about 30 years ago) when having a black-light poster in your room was the epitome of cool. Black-light posters use inks that fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light, absorbing the UV radiation and re-emitting it as visible light -- preferably in the most garish colors imaginable.
        In nature, when it comes to the most garish colors imaginable, few animals can beat the parrot. So it is not surprising that parrot plumage contains fluorescent pigments that add to the bird's glowing look in natural light, which contains ultraviolet, as well as visible rays.
        The question for a researcher at the University of Glasgow and colleagues was whether a parrot's fluorescence serves some function. As they report in the journal Science, fluorescence appears to make the parrot the epitome of cool, at least to the opposite sex.
        The researchers studied wild budgerigars, or budgies, with fluorescent yellow patches on their crowns and cheeks. The scientists took two budgies of the same sex, and applied sunscreen to the fluorescent plumage of one (to block the absorption of UV and, thus, the fluorescence) and petroleum jelly to the other (which slickens the plumage but does not absorb UV). Then a budgie of the opposite sex was allowed to choose one of the birds for a mate.
        The researchers found that the birds showed a significant preference for those without the sunscreen, indicating that fluorescence, far from being just a byproduct of a parrot's pigmentation, is actually an adaptive sexual signal.
        Dual Benefit for Shipping
        The ballast water used to stabilize cargo ships has a bad reputation among conservationists for the damage it can cause to ecosystems by introducing invasive marine organisms when it is pumped out in a port or along a coast. Ballast water has a bad reputation among shipping companies, too, because the dissolved oxygen in the water can cause rust and corrosion in the tanks that hold it.
        Over the years, techniques have been devised to reduce the problem of invasive species, and other methods have been developed to deal with corrosion. Now, research shows that a new technique may help with both problems.
        The process, developed in Japan, involves bubbling nitrogen gas through the water to deoxygenate it. The technique is intended to prevent corrosion. But the new research, led by a scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, shows that the deoxygenated water also kills the larvae of several known invaders, including the zebra mussel.
        The researchers, who published their work in the journal Biological Conservation, point out that deoxygenation would probably not kill all potentially invasive species. But because it provides an economic benefit to shippers, by reducing the need for expensive repainting or other treatments for corroded tanks, it may be more likely to be used than other methods for killing organisms in ballast water that do not offer such economic incentives.
        The Interfering Iceberg
        A giant Antarctic iceberg that has been slowly drifting since it broke off the Ross Ice Shelf nearly two years ago is posing a threat to emperor and Adelie penguins on Ross Island. The iceberg is jammed up against the northern coast of the island, forcing breeding penguins to cross it to reach the sea and food for their young. An official with New Zealand's Antarctic agency estimated that the birds had to walk an additional 30 miles each way.
        The time and distance involved can leave the birds with little food for their offspring. The survival rate of penguin chicks, already fairly low, may be reduced even further. Emperor and Adelie penguins have large breeding colonies, numbering in the tens of thousands of breeding pairs, on the island.
