        Re ''China Pursues Major Role in Particle Physics'' (Dec. 5): I was jolted and distressed at the sight of a photograph of Mao Zedong on the first page of Science Times. After all, as the accompanying article informs us, Mao ''closed universities and journals and set back Chinese physics for a generation.''
        Mao was one of the great monsters of history. During the Great Leap Forward, he ordered farmers to melt their tools to produce metal for industry, one of the factors that led to the famine of 1959-61. The metal turned out to be unusable. Does Chairman Mao belong on the front page of Science Times?
