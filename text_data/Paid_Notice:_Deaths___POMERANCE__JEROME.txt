        POMERANCE--Jerome. The staff of Kroll Associates mourns the passing of our friend and former Managing Director Jerome Pomerance. Our chief operating officer for eight years, Jerry helped shepherd Kroll as we grew through the 1980's to become an international firm and the leader in our field. Generous of spirit and caring of his colleagues, he was famously organized and meticulous, and gave us the structure and organization we needed to achieve our goals. We will miss his passion, his drive, his breadth of knowledge, and most of all his humor. We convey our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Fredi, daughter Janice, son-in-law Yoji and his grandchildren, Clare and David. The Employees of Kroll Associates
