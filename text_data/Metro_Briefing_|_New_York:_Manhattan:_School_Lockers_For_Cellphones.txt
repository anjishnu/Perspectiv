        The City Education Department said it planned to test a program that would allow students to leave their cellphones in small storage lockers outside city school buildings. A ban on cellphones in public schools has become a major source of contention between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who views them as a distraction, and critics who say children need phones for safety. City education officials said they did not know how many schools would participate in the pilot project, which will begin in September and was reported yesterday in The New York Post. The storage lockers will be installed and operated by a private vendor, charging students 25 to 50 cents per day.
