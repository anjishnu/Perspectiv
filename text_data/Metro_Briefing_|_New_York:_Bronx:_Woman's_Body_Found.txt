        The body of a 55-year-old Bronx woman was found wrapped in a blanket on her bedroom floor after she had been missing for two days, the police said. Worried after not hearing from her for some time, her grandson had called the police, who then entered the apartment. It was unclear how the woman had died, as investigators had not unwrapped the blanket as of late last night, the police said. Nor was it clear who had left her body on the floor, as there were no signs of forced entry into the apartment, at 1993 Bathgate Avenue, near 178th Street. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death, the police said.
