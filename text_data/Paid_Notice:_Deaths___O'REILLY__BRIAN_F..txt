        O'REILLY--Brian F., age 23. Cherished son of Francis and Philomena. Beloved brother of Patrick (Claire) and Kevin. Devoted friend to countless. A St. Francis Prep 2001 and Cornell 2005 graduate, Brian fought a courageous sevenyear battle with osteosarcoma, succumbing on December 18, 2006. Brave and undaunted, he never complained and was always wonderfully optimistic. He would not allow cancer to keep him from living a full life, traveling to Australia, Hawaii, Europe, and Alaska despite the pain of his condition. He was a devoted fundraiser for the American Cancer Society's ''Relay For Life.'' He loved comedy and Seinfeld, and attended filming of Saturday Night Live, Conan O'Brien, and The Daily Show in the last days of his life. Brian's cheerfulness and sense of humor never wavered amidst his suffering. He will forever be an inspiration to those who knew and loved him. Calling hours at the Leo F. Kearns Funeral Home, Woodhaven Blvd. at Dry Harbor Rd., Rego Park, Thursday and Friday, 2 to 4 and 7 to 9pm. Mass of Christian Burial St. Matthias Church, Ridgewood, Saturday 9:15am. Consistent with Brian's wishes, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Sarcoma Foundation of America, PO Box 458, Damascus, MD 20872.
