        Westchester's property taxes, the highest in the nation according to a recent survey, will be even higher next year, but not as high as the county executive had proposed.
        The Democratic-controlled county Board of Legislators approved next year's $1.7 billion budget on Dec. 11. The budget raises the county tax levy by 3.5 percent and increases financing for arts, day care and social service programs. Two days later, the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, signed the budget into law. Last month, he proposed a 3.98 percent tax increase.
        During the budget debate, Republican legislators argued that the county should hold the line on taxes. But Bill Ryan, a Democrat who is chairman of the board, said the panel avoided the kind of large property tax increases passed in the early part of the decade while still maintaining county services.
        Mr. Spano had proposed a 5 percent increase in financing for not-for-profit arts and social services groups that receive support from the county. The Legislature approved a 7.5 percent rise for the organizations -- their first increase since 2002.
        In October, a study by the Tax Foundation, a Washington research group, found that Westchester's property taxes were the highest in the nation in 2005, with the median homeowner paying $7,337.
