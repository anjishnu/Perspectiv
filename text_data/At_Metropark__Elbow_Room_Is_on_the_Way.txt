        The Metropark station in Iselin, one of New Jersey Transit's busiest, will undergo renovation to widen and lengthen its platforms, create new waiting areas and enhance its communication systems.
        The New Jersey Transit board of directors announced on Wednesday that it had approved a $29.8 million contract for the construction with Anselmi & DeCicco, of Maplewood. Design and other costs are expected to make the total tab nearly $50 million.
        The new platforms will be able to handle up to 12 rail cars, up from 10 now, and waiting areas on the platform will have extended canopies and climate controls, said Dan Stessel, a New Jersey Transit spokesman.
        Metropark, which opened in 1971, is the fourth-busiest station in the New Jersey Transit system, handling 7,200 riders a day on 106 trains. Kris Kolluri, the state transportation commissioner, said the project would enable the station to serve more riders.
        Construction will begin early next year and is scheduled for completion in 2010. The work will include a renovated pedestrian tunnel; a walkway from the platforms to Route 27, which runs alongside the station; improved lighting, and a remodeled station building.
        Also last week, New Jersey Transit began using the first of its new multilevel rail cars on the Northeast Corridor line. Each costs $1.9 million and, with upper, lower and mezzanine levels, offers 15 to 20 percent more seating than the cars now in use while eliminating the three-seat rows and adding an inch of legroom.
        New Jersey Transit accommodates more than 74,000 riders on the line in and out of Pennsylvania Station in New York every day.
        The agency expects to have 234 cars, which at 14 1/2 feet are a foot taller than the current cars, on the tracks by 2008.
