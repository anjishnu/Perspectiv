        ''Before Children Ask, 'What's Recess?' '' (Dec. 10) is a sad commentary on the state of our educational leadership and administration.
        At a time when health care costs are out of control and childhood diabetes and obesity are increasing, the geniuses behind No Child Left Behind have created a system that requires a tradeoff of recess for test preparation.
        This will produce adequate readers with health issues that will affect them and society negatively for as long as they live.

        I am a fifth grader who goes to a school in Rockville Centre, N.Y., that has almost no recess.
        At my school, Riverside Elementary, we have 20 minutes to go outside during a six-and-a-half-hour school day!
        Our recess goes from 11:40 a.m. until 12. Fifth grade can only play kickball, or do nothing.
        We stay indoors if it is below 36 degrees. If there is a rain cloud, we stay inside. If there is a snowflake, we stay inside. We are usually not allowed to go out if there are puddles.
        I hope recess goes to at least 30 minutes.
