        A 14-year-old girl was convicted yesterday in Bronx Family Court of killing her newborn when she pushed the baby out of her bedroom window moments after giving birth. The girl gave birth to a boy on her bedroom floor on Jan. 14, 2005, in her family's apartment in Morrisania, said Kimberley Capers, an assistant district attorney. No adult had been aware of her pregnancy, Ms. Capers said, adding that the baby's father, a 15-year-old, had said he wanted to keep the baby. The girl told the authorities that after she gave birth, she lay on her bed with the child but later went to the window because she felt hot. She said the child slipped through the window guard and fell three stories. The girl faces five years' confinement in a juvenile detention center on the charge of second-degree murder, Ms. Capers said.
