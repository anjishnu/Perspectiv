        BRICKMAN-Seymour. The Board of Directors and Staff of NY Psychotherapy and Counseling Center mourn the passing of Rabbi Seymour Brickman on December 10, 2006. Seymour served with distinction for the past 25 years as a member of our Board of Directors, including the past 15 years as President of the Board. His leadership and vision was instrumental in the growth of New York Psychotherapy and to the quality of treatment it provides. His humanity, compassion, optimism, and genial nature will be missed. He was a gentle and wise man beloved by all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Devora, and his entire family at this difficult time. Elliott Klein, Executive Director. Jack Schnee, Medical Director.
