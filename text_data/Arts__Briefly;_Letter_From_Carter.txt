        Former President Jimmy Carter released a 1,000-word letter addressed to ''Jewish citizens of America'' yesterday, defending his new book, ''Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,'' which compares the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories to the former government-mandated racial separation in South Africa. In the letter posted on the Carter Center Web site (cartercenter.org), Mr. Carter wrote that he has ''never claimed that American Jews control the news media,'' and that what he calls overwhelming bias for Israel in the United States comes from Christians like himself who have been taught to ''honor and protect'' Jewish people. But he reiterated that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee has a ''powerful influence'' in promoting bias for Israel, and that he believes no significant countervailing voices exist.
