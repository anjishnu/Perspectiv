        To the Editor:
        ''Sunrise and Sunset,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Dec. 14), illustrates the misguided ideology of the Bush administration, which is unbending in its promotion of the ''right to life'' of each and every embryo, and yet takes no responsibility for the lives of our children once they are born.
