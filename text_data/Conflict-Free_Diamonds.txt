        Re ''Diamonds Are for Never?'' (Thursday Styles, Dec. 14):
        Since there is still doubt that diamond buyers can be assured that they are not buying conflict diamonds, the time is ripe for fair-trade diamonds to boost the economy of African nations and benefit workers.
        Envision an industry where diamonds are mined, polished and made into final products within Africa. Workers are paid living wages with benefits, have good working conditions, with no child or slave labor, and the ability to freely organize -- all verified by independent oversight.
        The continent's economy will benefit by producing final products, not just raw materials. And buyers could then feel good about their purchases.
