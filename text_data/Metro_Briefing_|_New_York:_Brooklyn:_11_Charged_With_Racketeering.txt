        Federal prosecutors said yesterday that 11 men associated with the Colombo organized-crime family had been indicted on various charges, including racketeering conspiracy, robbery conspiracy and loan sharking. The men were part of a mob crew on Staten Island, said Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. Prosecutors said that among other crimes, the crew planned to rob an armored car outside a bank on Hylan Boulevard on Staten Island on Aug. 4, but that the Drug Enforcement Administration disrupted the plot. The men pleaded not guilty at their arraignment in Federal District Court, prosecutors said.
