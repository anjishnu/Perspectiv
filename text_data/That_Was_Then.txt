        To the Editor:
        In his Week Ahead report [Dec. 10] on the new book ''Acts of Light: Martha Graham in the Twenty-First Century,'' John Rockwell writes of ''the lawsuits, the financial debt, the managerial instability.'' But that is all in the past. The lawsuits are over and no one can seriously question the troupe's right to perform the Graham repertory. The deficit that topped $5 million this time last year has now dipped well below $1 million and, although some friends questioned my personal stability when I agreed to take over as executive director of the Martha Graham Center in January, the company is considerably more secure now. Much work remains to be done, but 18 weeks of successful performances have jump-started the recovery.
