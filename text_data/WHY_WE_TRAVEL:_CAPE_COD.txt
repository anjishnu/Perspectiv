        Art Figur, 75, third from right, from New Rochelle, N.Y., medical director of Mount Sinai Hospital, at the Cape Cod Old-Timers Longboard Classic with fellow participants in the 50 and above category. ''I started taking vacations on Cape Cod around 1965 or 1966. My friends and I spent a considerable amount of time surfing. They had a fund-raiser back then, and it was called the old-timers contest because you had to be over 18 to enter. When the drinking age changed from 18 to 21, you had to be over 21. I hadn't been there in a while. This year I did catch a few waves and was riding them lying down. But then I was on my knees for a few seconds, praying that I could stand up. As soon as I got on my knees, I got the old feeling.''
