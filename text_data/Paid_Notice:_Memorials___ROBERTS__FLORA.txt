        ROBERTS--Flora, December 12, 1998. 8 years seems a long time ago, but the essence of your spirit lives on in all of us privileged to have known and loved you. We cherish your memory and all the laughter, drama and hard work it evokes, let alone the wisdom, instinct and supportive love we miss everyday. Helen Brann
