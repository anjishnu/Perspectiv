        Here is a clever way to cover leftovers: translucent silicone lids by Kuhn-Rikon and Silicone Zone that fit various size bowls and containers. When pressed into place, these lids form a gentle vacuum seal that keeps the food fresher. They are sturdy enough to allow containers to be stacked and can also be used as trivets.
        The Kuhn-Rikon model, in rounds from 8 to 12 1/2 inches in diameter, $13.95 to $19.95 at cooking.com, has a metal rim. Those by Silicone Zone, $11 to $25.99 for rounds from 6 inches, and including an oblong 9 by 13 inches, come in colors and are sold at Art of Cooking in Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Kitchen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and at cookwareessentials.com.
