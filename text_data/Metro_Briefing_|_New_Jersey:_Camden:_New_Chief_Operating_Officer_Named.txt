        Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced yesterday that he would appoint a former State Superior Court judge as the interim chief operating officer for Camden. The former judge, Theodore Z. Davis, will serve in the post while the state searches for a long-term replacement. Mr. Davis, a life-long Camden resident, served on the court there for 22 years. The office of chief operating officer, who is responsible for the operation of city services, was created in 2002 as part of the state's assumption of financial oversight of Camden.
