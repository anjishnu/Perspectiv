        An investigation into the personal finances of Charles J. Haughey, who served three terms as prime minister from 1979 to 1992, concluded that he received more than $15 million in secret payments from rich businesspeople and ''lived a lifestyle and incurred expenditures vastly beyond the scale of the public service entitlements which were his sole apparent income.'' The report confirmed what the country had long suspected. Mr. Haughey, 80, died in June.
