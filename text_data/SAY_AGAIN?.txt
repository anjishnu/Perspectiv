        How to distract journalists from a C.E.O.? Ford had a better idea: bagpipes.
        Reporters at Ford's holiday party last week were startled when a troupe of Scottish Society bagpipers marched into the Fox Theater, interrupting a scrum around Ford's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally. The drummer, Eric Mayne, a reporter with the industry newsletter Ward's Automotive Reports, said the group had a gig at a nearby Veteran's Administration hospital, but was invited to drop by the Ford party.
        The strategy was only partly successful. Despite the droning and drumming, Mr. Mulally was properly grilled.
