        Re: ''A Year-Round Craving for the Latkes of Yore,'' Dec. 6, by Alex Witchel:
        I didn't have a Jewish grandmother to show me how to make latkes, but as what some might call a Jew by marriage, I've been making them for nearly two decades. Grating the onion alternately with the potato (I use double the onion Ms. Witchel does), then mixing them together for draining staves off discoloration of the potato.
