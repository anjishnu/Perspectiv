        Yet another accessory for the iPod? Thankfully, the Hangman from Neat Products offers a clever twist.
        This tiny piece of plastic connects to the synching and charging port on the bottom of the iPod and has a stainless steel link that hooks onto a belt loop or backpack.
        You then wrap the slack of the headphone cable around the Hangman and let the iPod dangle in the wind. To remove the Hangman, you press a button and it pops off.
        The Hangman keeps your iPod close at hand and away from the clutter at the bottom of your bag, where it can be scratched and cracked. It fits third-, fourth- and fifth-generation iPods, along with the Mini and the Nano. It is just about a quarter of an inch thick and weighs less than half an ounce.
        The Hangman comes in black or gray and is available for $19.95 at www.neatproducts.com.
        Fans of wearable technology -- if they exist -- could feasibly wear a Hangman-connected iPod as a fancy medallion. It could happen.
