        The Polish oil company PKN Orlen closed a deal to buy 53.7 percent of the Mazeikiu Nafta refinery in Lithuania for $1.46 billion from Yukos. The company is expected to buy an additional 30.6 percent of the refinery from the Lithuanian government for $851 million. PKN is buying the refinery in spite of a fire and pipeline accident that hurt profits at the plant. Russia, which supplies the plant with crude and had opposed the sale to a Polish company, has yet to repair the pipeline, which ruptured in July in Russian territory.
