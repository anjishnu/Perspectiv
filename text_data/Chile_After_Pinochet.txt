        Re ''The Half-Life of a Despot,'' by Ariel Dorfman (Op-Ed, Dec. 12):
        While it may be impossible for survivors of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's regime to exorcise him from memory, the battle for Chile's soul is not lost.
        General Pinochet's arrest in London almost a decade ago showed that the victims who had been struggling for years to bring him to justice had international support. It opened a door in Chile that many thought was closed forever, and thus delegitimized General Pinochet's version of the truth and set off a reversal of policies that once made impunity the law of the land.
        Today, dozens of former military personnel -- responsible for tens of thousands of cases of torture, ill treatment, disappearances, killings and forced exile -- continue to live at large, in Chile and abroad. Chile's government and judiciary have clear choices: they can bring these perpetrators to justice or allow justice delayed to become justice denied.
