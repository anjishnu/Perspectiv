        The medical care for children in state custody is ''a bleak picture, and rooted in profound human suffering,'' the state comptroller, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, said in a report. The report said that the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services lacked a full-time medical director, and that effective clinical treatment was further hampered by inadequate record keeping and an undue reliance on in-patient psychiatric care and psychotropic drugs. Ms. Strayhorn said she had referred to the inspector general of the state health commission several cases of potential fraud and abuse in delivering services to foster children.
