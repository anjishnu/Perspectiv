        Dual-Threat Dynamo  Calling to mind Marshall Faulk, the man he replaced, the Rams' STEVEN JACKSON, above, has been a dynamo as a rusher and a receiver this season. Despite rushing for more than 100 yards just three times, Jackson is on pace for 1,365 yards. He also has 82 catches, and at his current rate, he would tie Larry Centers for most receptions by a running back in a season. The Raiders, the Rams' opponent today, provide an interesting challenge for Jackson: they have the league's top-ranked passing defense. But they are only 25th against the run. Running or receiving, Jackson is likely to be the Rams' offensive key.
        In the Shadows  All eyes will be on the matchup of star running backs, LaDAINIAN TOMLINSON versus LARRY JOHNSON, so it is possible that Chargers tight end ANTONIO GATES will fly under the radar and take over the game. Having started the season slowly with the new quarterback PHILIP RIVERS, Gates has been steadily improving and has increased his yardage each of the last three weeks, culminating in a 104-yard, 2-touchdown performance last week against the Broncos.
        Eagles' Biggest Outlet  The last time L. J. SMITH, above, played against the Giants, he had 7 catches for 111 yards. His season has not continued at that pace, but he has been a good safety valve for JEFF GARCIA. Smith has scored touchdowns in three of his last four games, and he will probably be one of Garcia's favorite targets against a Giants passing defense that is ranked 29th in the league.
