        In Hollywood, the American Cinematheque is offering a rare, rich glimpse into the work of NICHOLAS RAY, one of American film's most powerful artists and among its most tortured souls. On Wednesday, the final day of the series, ''REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE'' will be screened. Undoubtedly his most famous film, the mythic tale of teenage discontent and generational alienation sketches the broad lines of the social angst of the rest of the century. The film is important for myriad reasons, including Ray's groundbreaking compositions and use of color, but you don't care about that. You just want to see James Dean and Natalie Wood mooning about.

        The Chinese filmmaker ZHANG YIMOU was reportedly given the largest budget ever for a Chinese film to make his new epic, ''CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER,'' which Sony Pictures Classics will open on 50 screens across the country on Thursday. This is the director who dazzled with the magnificent ''House of Flying Daggers'' in 2004 and the (surprise) blockbuster ''Hero'' in 2002. His new film is yet another epic of love, betrayal and family ties (among royals) and features CHOW YUN FAT and GONG LI as emperor and empress. As in his earlier movies, the plot doesn't matter so much: the colors, textures, sounds and sumptuous costumes are what make it worth the trip. And don't expect any of those cool fight scenes until the second half of the film.
