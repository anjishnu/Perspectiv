        A year after he moved in, the furnituremaker John Houshmand is putting the finishing touches on his showroom in SoHo, a 5,000-square-foot space where he has installed an 11-foot-tall maple tree carcass. The showroom features his tables, benches, shelving and other pieces made using solid, natural-edge slabs of wood, most of it salvaged or sustainably harvested American timber. Many of the designs, including his credenza with mounted elm slabs (right, $19,730) and 2Fold black walnut side table (above, $6,300), incorporate glass or blackened steel, while a new, lower-priced collection consists of five pieces -- a bench and coffee and side tables -- under $5,000 each: 31 Howard Street, second floor (by appointment); (212) 965-1238; www.johnhoushmand.com.
