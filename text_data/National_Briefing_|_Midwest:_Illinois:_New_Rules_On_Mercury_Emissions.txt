        Coal-fired power plants in Illinois will be required to reduce their mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2009, according to strict new state rules. The rules, which exceed federal standards requiring a 78-percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2018, are part of a plan intended to reduce toxic air pollution introduced by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich earlier this year.
