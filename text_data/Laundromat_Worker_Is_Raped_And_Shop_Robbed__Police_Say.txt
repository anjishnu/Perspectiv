        A 46-year-old employee of a Queens Laundromat who had just opened it for the morning was raped yesterday at knifepoint by two men who also robbed the business, the police said.
        They said that two men entered the Laundromat, on 71st Street in Jackson Heights, shortly after 7 a.m. and forced the woman to the rear of the store, where she was raped. The victim was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center for examination, the police said.
        Zhong Ling, the owner of the Laundromat, said it was robbed of several hundred dollars. ''Somebody took my money,'' said Mr. Ling, 35, who has owned the Laundromat for several years.
        Three weeks earlier, a bar two doors down from the Laundromat was robbed at gunpoint at closing time, said Jim Giannone and Frank Giannone, the co-owners of the business, The Ranger Texas Barbecue at Legends.
        But many were surprised that the Laundromat -- which draws a steady crowd of customers dressed in saris, jeans or sweatpants -- would be the target of such an attack, even in the early morning before most of the other businesses were open.
        ''I'm surprised because the owner is always here, always,'' said Daniel Crespo, 45, a regular Laundromat customer.
        News of the attack sent reverberations along the strip of neighboring family-owned businesses in the primarily residential neighborhood. Some were planning to take extra security precautions.
        Nur Aktar, 42, the owner of a Bangladeshi fish market and halal butcher, said she would no longer open her shop by herself. ''I'm so scared. I'm alone,'' she said.
        Rusth Asadullah, an employee at Titash Discount and Housewares, said, ''I told my boss I need a camera.''
        Mr. Asadullah, who works next door to the Laundromat, said he knew the victim.
        ''She was my customer. She always came for phone cards,'' he said. ''She's a very nice lady.''
