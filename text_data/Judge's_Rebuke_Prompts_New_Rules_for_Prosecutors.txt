        It was a ruling that sent shudders through the Justice Department.
        Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan in June issued a scathing criticism of the prosecution's tactics in a criminal case against former tax professionals of the accounting firm KPMG. The government, the judge said, ''let its zeal get in the way of its judgment.''
        For one, the judge cited the prosecutors' pledge earlier in the case that they would examine ''under a microscope'' whether KPMG was paying the legal fees of the defendants. KPMG ultimately refused to pay the defendants' legal expenses, he wrote ''because the government held the proverbial gun to its head.''
        While the judge's comments were stinging, it was the comments by the federal prosecutors that prompted some serious soul-searching within the Justice Department in Washington. ''It's just not necessary'' to use that kind of language, a top Justice official told a defense lawyer at the time.
        Months later, those private discussions have now produced new guidelines, known as the McNulty memorandum. Under them, a company's decision to pay legal fees will not be held against it, except in extreme circumstances, when prosecutors are weighing whether to indict the company. The new guidelines also raise new hurdles for prosecutors seeking access to confidential legal communications.
        A decisive moment that led to the new guidelines came a few days after Thanksgiving, in a conference room in the Justice Department's main building. In a meeting lasting several hours before a fireplace, the deputy attorney general, Paul J. McNulty, discussed the proposed changes with one of his predecessors, George J. Terwilliger III, who was deputy attorney general under the first President Bush.
        Mr. Terwilliger, a friend of Mr. McNulty's, had recently had first-hand experience with the guideline criticized in the KPMG case that gave companies under investigation a black mark if they advance legal fees to their employees caught up in the investigation.
        The draft passage that Mr. McNulty showed Mr. Terwilliger proposed a slight shift: that prosecutors would have to use several tests to determine whether companies that paid the legal fees were hindering investigators.
        In an interview this week, Mr. Terwilliger said he had told Mr. McNulty: ''Rather than try to establish a list of all-inclusive criteria about the circumstances where it would be appropriate or not to pay counsel fees, why not have a bottom-line standard saying it's appropriate to do so except in extremely limited circumstances?''
        Mr. Terwilliger cited the recent case of Schnitzer Steel Industries, an Oregon scrap steel company that averted a possible indictment over bribes paid to Asian steel concerns and instead reached a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in October.
        Mr. Terwilliger, who represented Schnitzer Steel, noted that prosecutors did not object to the company's payment of legal fees to employees caught up in the inquiry. He cited an internal Justice document that called the payments ''a positive'' for the criminal inquiry because employees would speak to Justice investigators only if they had proper legal counsel, paid by the company.
        Mr. Terwilliger was one of several former senior Justice officials from past Republican administrations whom Mr. McNulty consulted. Two former attorneys general, Edwin Meese III and Richard L. Thornburgh, both urged a thorough revision of the old guidelines. But Mr. McNulty, himself a former prosecutor in Pennsylvania, said in an interview this week that he considered the advice of Mr. Terwilliger ''especially significant.''
        Mary Beth Buchanan, a Pennsylvania federal prosecutor, said Mr. McNulty ''had been listening to the concerns of the corporate counsel bar and defense bar for some time.''
        Those lawyers had also been telling Mr. McNulty that the old guidelines had made companies less likely to root out fraud internally because executives were afraid to talk to in-house lawyers, for fear of having their communications obtained coercively by prosecutors.
        The process of redrafting the guidelines picked up speed after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the proposal. After that hearing, Mr. McNulty ''realized that there was a perception problem out there'' that the old guidelines were abusive, a senior Justice Department official said.
        The first draft revision of what would become the McNulty memorandum appeared shortly after that, according to the senior Justice official.
        But that was just the beginning; there would be no fewer than 10 drafts before the final memo.
        The second sticking point, after the legal fees issues, concerned how to address the problem of prosecutors asking for confidential legal communications, or information protected by attorney-client privilege. One solution suggested creating multiple categories of legal information for which prosecutors could ask companies to waive privilege.
        But the decisive view came from the attorney general's advisory committee, an internal Justice department body composed of senior prosecutors around the country. It proposed an unusual solution: set up a two-tiered system separating more-sensitive legal information from less-sensitive legal information, and make it harder for prosecutors to go after the former.
        Karin J. Immergut, the Oregon federal prosecutor who heads the committee's white collar crime sub-committee that was reviewing the drafts, said, ''The approach set forth is one that the vast majority of prosecutors were already using around the country, but there is additional guidance and additional accountability, to address the concerns.''
        More wrangling was still to come. Officials in the Justice Department's criminal division and senior federal prosecutors, who ''don't want anyone in Washington messing with their toolbox,'' according to the senior Justice official, argued over whether waiver requests would have to be authorized by the local United States attorney supervising the investigation, by a midlevel official in the main Justice Department, or by Mr. McNulty himself.
        Last week, in the days before the final draft was issued, Mr. McNulty continued to consult with Mr. Terwilliger, in one instance spending over an hour with him on the telephone ''talking back and forth trying to make up his mind'' about who should be required to approve the waiver requests, among other issues, according to the senior Justice official.
        The final version, which was announced on Tuesday, gave Mr. McNulty the power to authorize waiver requests.
