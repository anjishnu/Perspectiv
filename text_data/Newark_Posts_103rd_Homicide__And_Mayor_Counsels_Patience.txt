        A 38-year-old man was shot and killed outside a restaurant here on Monday night, becoming the 103rd person murdered in the city this year and pushing the number of homicides to the highest level since 1995.
        The man, whose name was withheld by the police pending the notification of his family, was shot three times in the chest about 11 p.m. outside the Ho Kim Chinese restaurant on Central Avenue and Third Street, according to the police. He died two hours later.
        The killing comes at a difficult time for Newark's new mayor, Cory A. Booker, who has made fighting crime a central tenet of his mission to improve life in New Jersey's biggest city. Although the police have succeeded in steeply reducing overall crime since Mr. Booker took office in July -- and the pace of killings has slowed in recent months -- the total number of murders has continued to rise to levels not seen since the late 1980s and early 1990s. Newark had a record 161 homicides in 1981.
        Mr. Booker, who hired a high-ranking crime strategist from New York to be his police director, said his administration needs more time to bring down the murder rate.
        The police director, Garry McCarthy, said the department had reduced shootings by 25 percent in recent months and that the number of murders was sure to follow. ''While we've made significant strides by reducing overall crime and shooting incidents in our city, it is not enough,'' he said Tuesday night.
        Investigators said they believed Monday night's shooting was the result of an argument between the victim and another man, whom they are seeking to identify. They said the victim's girlfriend witnessed the killing.
        Officials on Tuesday also added another homicide to the year's tally after an elderly man, who was injured two weeks earlier during what the police described as an aggravated assault, died from his injuries.
