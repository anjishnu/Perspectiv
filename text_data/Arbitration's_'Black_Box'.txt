        Re ''When Winning Feels a Lot Like Losing'' (Fair Game, Dec. 10), in which Gretchen Morgenson described how an investor won her arbitration case but was ordered to pay more in fees than she was awarded in damages:
        I have served as an arbitrator on NASD panels for over 10 years. The purpose of arbitration is to provide an economical and speedy alternative to the courts, and in most cases I believe it succeeds. But the credibility of the system is jeopardized when arbitrators can render decisions without explanation.
        Under the current system, arbitration is a ''black box'' where the panel hears the evidence, goes through an opaque process of deliberation and renders a decision without explaining its basis. If the arbitrators were required to write a reasoned opinion, it would force them to explicitly examine their findings and confirm that they lead to the resulting decision.
