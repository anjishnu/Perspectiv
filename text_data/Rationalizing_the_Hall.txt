        Re ''Add Father Time to the List of Those Bonds Is Defying,'' Dec. 9: William C. Rhoden would have Barry Bonds in baseball's Hall of Fame. His reasons: Bonds was Hall of Fame caliber before the steroid allegations, and he is the most complete baseball player and among the best hitters.
        By rationalizing the cheating allegation, why not send Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose to the Hall of Fame?
