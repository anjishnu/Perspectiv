        Less than a month after a 15-year-old Bronx boy died after being physically restrained by employees in a Fulton County detention center, state officials announced plans yesterday to limit such restraints. The recommendations, disclosed at a State Assembly hearing in Manhattan, would end the use of physical restraints for youths who disobey orders or harm property, but would allow the restraints when youths are fleeing, causing serious disruptions or at risk of hurting themselves or others. Larry Brown, executive deputy commissioner of the State Office of Children and Family Services, which oversees juvenile detention facilities, said he expected the rule change to be enacted this month. The death, which remains under investigation, followed a damaging report in September by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union, which described abuse by employees at two girls' detention centers.
