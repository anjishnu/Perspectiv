        Competing workplace holiday parties on ''The Office'' propelled NBC to No. 2 in the ratings on Thursday night among adults 18 to 49, but CBS, with the second-to-last installment of ''Survivor: Cook Islands,'' led the night in total viewers. According to Nielsen's estimates, 8.5 million people tuned in for the hourlong ''Office'' episode at 8 p.m., starring Steve Carell, below. Meanwhile, ''Survivor,'' whose finale is on Sunday, remained dominant at 8 with 14.5 million viewers. NBC's comedies in the next hour, ''Scrubs'' at 9 (7.8 million) and ''30 Rock'' at 9:30 (6 million), trailed farther behind CBS, whose ''CSI'' repeat drew 15.1 million. Also at 9, Christmas arrived on ''The OC'' (Fox), and the show's ratings reached 4.3 million viewers, a season high, however meager. Of the three repeats at 10, NBC's ''ER'' (7.6 million) posted a slight advantage among adults 18 to 49, while CBS's ''Shark'' (10.1 million) drew the most viewers. ABC's all-rerun lineup finished the night in second place over all, ahead of NBC in total viewers.
