        To the Editor:
        In ''Rush to Judgment on Sex Offenders'' (editorial, Dec. 10), you argue against civil confinement legislation that would hold dangerous sex offenders involuntarily in hospitals after their sentences end. Why would you deny society's only recourse to keep sexual predators off the streets when the legal system fails us and hands down lenient sentences?
        We are far from doling out sentences that adequately address the dangers these perpetrators pose to society, so I find it misguided to advocate on the behalf of sex offenders instead of looking at the care and treatment of victims and the rest of society.
