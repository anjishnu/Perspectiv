        President Vladimir V. Putin said foreign spies in Russia had been ''showing heightened interest in classified economic information,'' the latest Kremlin expression of its worry that it has been under a growing threat from outside intelligence services. Mr. Putin's remarks, made on Security Services Day, followed public comments Tuesday by Nikolai P. Patrushev, the head of the domestic intelligence agency, who said foreign news media bureaus were increasingly being used by spies. Public hand-wringing about spies has been used to justify crackdowns against groups or classes the Kremlin deems as threats, including foreign nongovernmental organizations, whose activities were restricted and more closely regulated with a new law that took effect this year.
