        Re ''U.S. Report Finds Dismal Training of Afghan Police'' (front page, Dec. 4):
        The joint Pentagon and State Department report began with the key judgment that ''the U.S.-funded program to train and equip the Afghan National Police is generally well conceived and well executed.''
        There is certainly nothing ''dismal'' in that assessment, nor in the report's praise of our training and personnel elsewhere in the report.
        To be sure, training a new police force in a country that is desperately poor, emerging from 30 years of conflict and dictatorship, and plagued by illiteracy and underdevelopment presents serious challenges.
        Fully modern police institutions will not be created overnight, and the Afghans are just starting to build these from the ground up.
        It will take time to add experience to training and to refine training and procedures based on experience. I cannot say how long that will be or how long our government will be involved. But we are proud of the work we do in Afghanistan and proud to work with the State and Defense Departments.
        Most of all, we are proud of the American police officers who leave the safety of their communities and families to teach Afghan police how democratic policing is done in a modern society.
