        Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city had reached a tentative agreement with the Sanitation Officers Association. The pact, covering about 1,200 supervisors and district superintendents, is subject to membership ratification, officials said. It provides a 17 percent raise over 54 months; the union agreed to work-rule changes that city officials said would increase efficiency.
