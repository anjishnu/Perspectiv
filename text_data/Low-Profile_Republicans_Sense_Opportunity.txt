        The blast of conservative criticism aimed at Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for backing gay rights in 1994 has shaken his position as the social conservatives' favored challenger to Senator John McCain of Arizona for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Romney's problems have come as two high-profile conservative candidates have fallen by the wayside: Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee said he would not run, and Senator George Allen of Virginia is viewed in Republican circles as unviable for 2008 after losing his re-election. The two immediate beneficiaries? Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.
        ''The governor of Massachusetts is going to have a problem explaining the variety of positions he's taken on various issues,'' said Rob Wasinger, the chairman of Mr. Brownback's exploratory committee. Mr. Huckabee, referring to the fading of Mr. Frist and Mr. Allen, said, ''There is going to be a real look for a fresh face now.'' Whether or not these two men have the skills to take advantage of it, the opening is there. ''Social conservatives have some reason to be a little skeptical of the four top-tier candidates: Romney, McCain, Giuliani and Gingrich,'' said Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, the conservative magazine.
