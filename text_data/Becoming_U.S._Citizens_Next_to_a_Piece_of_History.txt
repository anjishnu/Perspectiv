        The 80 men and women from 30 countries -- Antigua to Yugoslavia -- stood up yesterday and took a moment's breath underneath a domed Roman-style ceiling in Lower Manhattan.
        They raised their right hands and made history, at least for themselves, by swearing the oath that made them American citizens.
        As mothers cradled toddlers and adult children winked at parents, they swore to ''abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince'' and defend the Constitution against ''all enemies, foreign and domestic.''
        While the oath was routine, the ceremony was rich in history.
        The new citizens were gathered in the former United States Custom House, now part of the Federal Hall National Memorial, where Federal Hall once stood when New York was the capital of the young nation. It was near there, on April 30, 1789, on the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, that George Washington also took an oath, as the first president.
        Yesterday's ceremony also involved a lesser-known chapter in American history: the struggle over what would become the Bill of Rights.
        New York was the 12th of the 13 original states to approve the Constitution and like most of the others said yes on the condition that a Bill of Rights be attached.
        The National Archives in Washington, which preserves documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, said the rare document detailing New York State's approval of the amendments that became the Bill of Rights would be on display at the Federal Hall National Memorial, at 26 Wall Street, until Sunday.
        It is the first time in more than two centuries that the ink-scrawled parchment, once folded into quarters to fit into a courier's pouch, has been on public display since the document was signed on March 27, 1790, according to the National Archives. It went on display yesterday just before the citizens were sworn in.
        For Natella O'Bryant, who was born in Ukraine, the citizenship oath and the parchment's connection to the Bill of Rights were stirring.
        ''It's an even more important day because part of the Bill of Rights is here,'' said Mrs. O'Bryant, an assistant vice president at a Manhattan bank. ''It's overwhelming. When I read the Bill of Rights, I realize that they are not on paper but live in reality.''
        Perhaps the most visually expressive of the new Americans was Hieu Trinh, 44, a worker in a nail salon who came to the United States from Vietnam in 2000.
        Upon receiving his certificate of citizenship, Mr. Trinh pumped both hands above his head, setting off flashes from news photographers gathered for the event.
        Mr. Trinh, who now lives in Chester, N.Y., and whose command of English is growing, said, ''I did that because my country is under Communism. I now live here and everything is freedom.''
        Perhaps the giddiest of the new citizens was Violet Isaac, 50, a nanny from Antigua, who danced around the rotunda and shouted, ''I love my new country, New York!''
        Amid all the elation, the newly minted Americans might be forgiven for failing to notice a minor footnote to history.
        Civil liberties advocates often note that the founding fathers must have considered the freedoms of speech, press and religion to be the paramount liberties in the Bill of Rights because they are included in the First Amendment.
        An examination of the amendments proposed by Congress to the states shows that those liberties were actually included in the Third Amendment.
        The first two amendments failed passage by the 13 states. The second amendment, concerning Congressional salaries, finally became part of the Constitution in 1992 as the 27th Amendment.
        The first amendment, if it had passed in 1790, would have limited the population of each Congressional district to no more than 50,000 people.
        The limit would have meant that today there would be 6,000 representatives.
        Correction:  December 16, 2006, Saturday  An article yesterday about a naturalization ceremony at the Federal Hall National Memorial in Manhattan misstated New York State's rank among the 13 original states to approve the Constitution. It was the 11th to do so, not the 12th.
