        Don't drive home after seeing the Psychic Ills in concert. With throbbing drones of distorted guitar, harsh electronic buzzes and rhythms so raw and repetitive they sound almost tribal, this New York quartet is highly skilled at disorienting its audience. Yet there's something exhilarating about its form of sonic hypnosis. The group has existed for only three years and is part of a close-knit scene of squally young New York bands. But its music conjures decades of the city's avant-garde rock, from the white noise of the Velvet Underground and the claustrophobic electronica of Suicide to the sprawling half-psychedelic, half-punk guitar clouds of Sonic Youth -- a tradition whose common thread is the musical illustration of the bad trip, the sensual or spiritual experience that twists into the horrific. This year the band released its debut album, ''Dins,'' as well as a spellbinding collection of its first singles, ''Early Violence,'' both on the Brooklyn-based Social Registry label. It ends a short national tour with this show at the Knitting Factory. Bad trips can be great. (Tomorrow at 10 p.m., with Indian Jewelry and Telepathe, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, 212-219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door.)
