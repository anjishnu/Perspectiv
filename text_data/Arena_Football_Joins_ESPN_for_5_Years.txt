        The Arena Football League announced yesterday a five-year agreement with ESPN, which acquired a minority ownership stake in the league.
        Neither ESPN nor the league disclosed how much of a stake ESPN had purchased.
        Next season, the network will televise 17 regular-season games, including 14 Monday night games on ESPN2, and 9 playoff games on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC. ESPN's coverage will begin on March 4 with two regional broadcasts on ABC: Dallas at New York and Chicago at Kansas City. ABC will also televise the league championship game in New Orleans on July 29.
        The deal came six months after the league and NBC, which had a revenue-sharing arrangement, severed ties after four years. The league's ratings on NBC fell from a 1.1 in 2003 to a 0.8 in 2006.
        ''This isn't dating; this is getting married,'' A.F.L. Commissioner David Baker said in a conference call. ''I think what's important about this partnership is that it's more than a simple television deal.''
        The league is seeking greater exposure, especially to young male viewers, through more news media platforms. The games carried on ESPN will be advertised on its numerous networks, its Web sites and its magazine.
        ''ESPN is the place where the American male gets their sports information, and being on ESPN immediately validates the league,'' Neal Pilson, a sports industry consultant who does some work for the league, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''No matter what time of day it is, there are always men 18 to 34 watching ESPN.''
