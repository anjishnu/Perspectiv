        The brilliant drug-addicted Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) contemplated rehab Tuesday, as Fox's ''House'' drew 16.1 million viewers at 9 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates, giving the network a victory for the night among adults 18 to 49. This compensated for Fox's ''Standoff'' (5 million), which ranked last in the 8 p.m. hour behind NBC's third-place ''Friday Night Lights'' (5.7 million). In total viewers CBS finished the night No. 1 ahead of Fox, aided by ''NCIS'' at 8 (17.4 million) and ''The Unit'' at 9 (13.5 million). ABC finished third over all, getting a boost from its 8 p.m. special, ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' (11 million). At 10, ABC's Barbara Walters special, ''The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006'' (8.8 million), led among adults 18 to 49, despite finishing third in the hour in total viewers to repeats on CBS and NBC.
