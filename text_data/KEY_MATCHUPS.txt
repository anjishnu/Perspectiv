        CHAD PENNINGTON vs. VIKINGS' PASS DEFENSE  The Vikings have given up an average of 28.2 yards rushing and 260.6 yards passing in their past five games. Matt Leinart of the Arizona Cardinals and Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers each threw for more than 300 yards against them, mainly because their teams could not run on the league's top-ranked rushing defense. Jets Coach Eric Mangini said he would not abandon the running game. ''I think you have to be able to incorporate both,'' he said. ''During the course of the game, sometimes you throw more, sometimes you run more. Sometimes it's about the flow of the game.'' For the Jets, it always comes down to Chad Pennington, above. In their past three victories, he has averaged 239 yards passing. In their past three losses, he has averaged 151 through the air.
