        NBC loosened its grip over Monday night's ratings, as CBS reasserted itself as No. 1 for the night. NBC dominated the 8 p.m. hour with ''Deal or No Deal,'' which drew 16.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates. The CBS comedies ''How I Met Your Mother'' at 8 (8.8 million) and ''The Class'' at 8:30 (8.7 million) were second in the hour, and a repeat of ABC's ''Wife Swap'' (7.4 million) ranked third. CBS led the next hour with ''Two and a Half Men'' at 9 (15.8 million) and ''The New Adventures of Old Christine'' at 9:30 (12.1 million). ''Two and a Half Men'' tied its season's best ratings among adults 18 to 49. A terrorism-themed ''CSI: Miami'' (15.9 million) gave CBS the lead at 10 p.m., too. In place of its new hit ''Heroes'' at 9, NBC broadcast a live-action remake of the 1974 Claymation film ''The Year Without a Santa Claus.'' The made-for-television movie, featuring John Goodman in the disgruntled title role, averaged 7.4 million viewers from 9 to 11. Among adults 18 to 49, it finished third behind ABC's second place offerings, ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.7 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (5.8 million).
