        ''Bill Would Give Adoptees Access to Birth Records'' (Dec. 10) highlights an important bill before the New Jersey Assembly that if passed would restore the right of adopted adults to have a copy of their birth certificate and give the same right to their parents while the adoptee is a minor. Two critics of the bill, Thomas J. Snyder and Lee Allen, argue that if the bill is enacted, people will give up any expectation of privacy.
        Actually, the bill preserves confidentiality. It simply provides an option for people to reveal their identities. The bill is about choice.
        What about the rights of adoptees? Do we not have the right to know where we came from? Who we are? Do we not have the right to know our medical history?
        I don't understand why everyone is always worrying about the birth mother and forgetting the adoptees.
