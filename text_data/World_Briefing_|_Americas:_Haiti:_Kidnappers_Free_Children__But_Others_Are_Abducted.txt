        A rash of kidnappings in Port-au-Prince has prompted the police and residents to conduct door-to-door searches for the victims, who are all children. On Thursday night, kidnappers freed seven children who had been taken from a school bus earlier in the week after their parents paid a ransom. But several other children were snatched, the police told news agencies. The authorities reported about 100 kidnappings last month and at least 60 this month, including a 6-year-old boy who was killed by his abductors.
