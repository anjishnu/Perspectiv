        A Jamaica man was convicted yesterday of fatally stabbing his tenant with a bayonet after an argument in August 2004, prosecutors said. The man, Rowland J. Erby, 62, of 102nd Avenue, was convicted in State Supreme Court of first-degree manslaughter, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said the conflict began when Mr. Erby left his house and found his wife talking with the tenant, Wayne Fung, 49, on the porch. He warned Mr. Fung to leave before he returned, but Mr. Fung was still there, so Mr. Erby went inside, returned with a bayonet and again warned him to leave. When Mr. Fung did not, Mr. Brown said, Mr. Erby stabbed him in the chest.
