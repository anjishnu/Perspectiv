        Correction:  December 15, 2006, Friday  A photograph in some copies on Wednesday showing the aftermath of a fire was published in error. The picture was of a fire on Pacific Street in Brooklyn last February, not the fire on Tuesday that destroyed a warehouse in Plainfield, N.J., and damaged the Fire Department headquarters next door.
