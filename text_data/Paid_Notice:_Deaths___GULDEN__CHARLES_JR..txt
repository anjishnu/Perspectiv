        GULDEN--Charles Jr., a retired food executive, passed away on December 14th in Stamford, CT. He was born in New York City on November 6, 1934. After suffering from Alzheimers for several years, Mr. Gulden had a short bout with cancer. Mr. Gulden was a graduate of the Hotchkiss School and then served in the Korean War. He then taught at the Harvey School, which was followed by a career in the food industry as an executive with Charles Gulden, Inc., the maker of Gulden's Mustard, which was founded in 1862 by his great grandfather, and later with American Home Products. In the early 1980's, Mr. Gulden was featured in several television ads for Gulden's. Throughout his life, he was an avid boater and reader. He was also a dedicated volunteer for the Hotchkiss School for many years: first as a class agent, then as Chairman of the Annual Fund, and finally as a member of the School's Board of Trustees.
