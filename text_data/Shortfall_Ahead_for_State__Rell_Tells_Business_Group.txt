        The state faces a projected budget shortfall of $400 million to $700 million for the 2007-8 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, Gov. M. Jodi Rell said last week in a speech to the Metro Hartford Alliance, a group of chamber of commerce executives from the greater Hartford area. It was the first time Mrs. Rell mentioned a projected shortfall. The current budget is expected to have a surplus of $486.5 million, said her spokesman, Rich Harris.
        Mr. Harris said the projected shortfall was the result of increased spending on pension funds, state programs and energy costs. ''If we continue to spend on the current track, inflation factors and ordinary growth in the budget would put us about $600 million in the red,'' he said.
        Francis W. Ahking, an associate professor of economics at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, said he was surprised by talk of a shortfall, considering that Mrs. Rell had spoken about property tax relief during her recent campaign.
        ''It suggests that she revised the economic growth forecast of the state,'' he said. ''The economic growth in the state is related to job growth, and Connecticut has been at or near the bottom of that category for the last five or six years.''
        In her speech, Mrs. Rell did not address ways to control spending, Mr. Harris said. He said she would present her new budget in the first week of February.
        Mr. Harris denied that Mrs. Rell's remark was a warning to Democrats, who control the legislature, about overspending.
        ''Everybody wants to do a lot of things on both sides of the aisle,'' he said. ''There are a huge amount of ideas out there, and being fiscally responsible is just good governance.''
