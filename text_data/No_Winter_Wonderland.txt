        Re ''The Snows of Yesteryear? Today They're in Machinery,'' by Peter Applebome (Our Towns, Dec. 6):
        Ski resort managers understand that global warming is responsible for the shorter, milder and unpredictable winters that are disastrous to snowfall, skiing and their profits.
        Their solution: Fire up the snowmakers that spew out tons of greenhouse gases every day, speeding up climate change and hastening the demise of their own industry.
        Surely economic self-interest, if not concern for a planetary future that Windham's manager acknowledges is ''terrifying,'' might lead them to rethink this suicidal business strategy.
