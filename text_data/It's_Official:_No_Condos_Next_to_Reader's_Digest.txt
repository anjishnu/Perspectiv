        A controversial plan to build 348 condominiums next to the storied Reader's Digest global headquarters in Chappaqua came to an abrupt end on Tuesday when the New Castle Town Board voted unanimously to reject the plan in the early stages of the review process.
        The board, which oversees the hamlet of Chappaqua, made its decision after months of opposition by neighbors concerned that the development would bring a surge in traffic and population, which could overwhelm the quaint, well-off community.
        ''There was a great reaction to the density of the proposal,'' said Janet L. Wells, the town supervisor.
        Summit Development and Greenfield Partners of South Norwalk, Conn., bought the 120-acre property from the Reader's Digest Association two years ago, leased some office space back to Reader's Digest and proposed the condominiums.
        ''Basically, when the mob shouted, the town board responded,'' Geoffrey Thompson, a spokesman for Summit and Greenfield, said.
        David Yeres, a lawyer who lives nearby, suggested the decision was democracy in action. ''I think it's fair to characterize reaction as an outpouring of opposition,'' he said.
        Mr. Thompson said the owners could wind up building additional office space and a smattering of single-family houses.
