        Unless Shea Hillenbrand agrees to a one-year contract to play first base, the Yankees may continue to collect veteran options for the job. They took Josh Phelps in the Rule 5 draft last week and have explored the idea of signing Doug Mientkiewicz.
        Mientkiewicz, a former Gold Glove winner, would be a major upgrade on defense over Jason Giambi, who will spend most of his time as the designated hitter.
        The downside is that Mientkiewicz bats left-handed and the Yankees would rather have a right-hander to balance a left-handed-leaning lineup. Phelps and the leading internal candidate, Andy Phillips, bat right-handed. The Yankees could go with a platoon of Mientkiewicz and Phillips or Phelps.
        Mientkiewicz batted .283 with a .359 on-base percentage for Kansas City last season but did not play after July 25 because of a back injury that needed surgery. He played for the Mets in 2005 and caught the last out of the World Series for Boston in 2004.
        The Yankees failed to tender a contract to outfielder Aaron Guiel, who was claimed off waivers from Kansas City on July 5. He batted .256 with 4 homers and 11 R.B.I. in 44 games with the Yankees, playing the outfield and first base.
