        Re ''Medicare, in a Different Tack, Moves to Link Doctors' Payments to Performance'' (news article, Dec. 12):
        Many physicians have long encouraged efforts to advance evidence-based care such as Medicare's ''pay for performance system'' passed by Congress. They do so because such steps are in the best interests of patients.
        In fact, initial drafts of the Medicare measures that will be used in the new quality incentive program did not appropriately cover surgical care. Our organization and others worked with Congress over the last year to develop measures that are intended to improve patient outcomes related to surgical care.
        Critics say pay-for-performance is an example of government bureaucrats telling doctors how to practice medicine.
        As long as Medicare relies on physicians to determine how this new program will work, we disagree. Improving the quality of patient care is a collaborative effort.
