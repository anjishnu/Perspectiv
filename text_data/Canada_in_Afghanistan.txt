        Re ''One War We Can Still Win,'' by Anthony H. Cordesman (Op-Ed, Dec. 13):
        In the aftermath of 9/11, I fully supported the American intervention in Afghanistan, and the participation of my country, Canada, in it.
        But after America entered Iraq, I called my member of Parliament and told her that because President Bush had demonstrated that he was no longer serious about winning the war on terror, I was withdrawing my support for the mission.
        Like many other Canadians, I do not wish to see one more Canadian soldier killed in a mission that America has waged half-heartedly. The enormous infusion of cash and manpower that a victory in Afghanistan requires have been squandered in Iraq, and left all of us less safe.
        The majority of Canadians no longer support the war, and we are pressing our government to bring our troops home.
