        A bone fragment found in a manhole at ground zero was identified as human yesterday by the office of the chief medical examiner, as the city continued its search for human remains from 9/11 in the area around the World Trade Center site. It was the first such discovery in more than a month. The fragment came from a different manhole than the one that held most of the 210 remains found earlier this fall, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner. She said recent inspections showed that there were no remains on the rooftops of the Millenium Hilton Hotel and 1 Liberty Plaza.
