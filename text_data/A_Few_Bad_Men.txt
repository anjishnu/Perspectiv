        Gabe Hudson's Lives column (Nov. 19) brought back some mixed memories. In 1955, I completed a similar course at Camp Lejeune. After graduation, I was kept on for a year as a platoon sergeant. The essay's conclusion struck a responsive chord; the guy you hate the most could be the one who saves your life. In 1960, as an infantry platoon leader, I had a C.O. who fit that description. He had received the Navy Cross for heroism at the Chosin Reservoir and drove us relentlessly. Though we all hated him, we also respected him. If our company went to war, he was the guy we wanted to lead us. But I do take issue with another part of Hudson's conclusion. The guys he called Meat and Potatoes stole a rifle from one of their fellow marines, his most important possession. In my day, that kind of action would rank right up there with losing your weapon. They were lucky to only get their butts chewed. Had they been my troops, I would have recommended them for nonjudicial punishment.
        If I were now in Iraq and had Meat and Potatoes as my fellow squad members, I would be concerned. What kind of stunt might they hatch to teach another marine a lesson and get somebody killed in the process? Could I depend on them in combat? I think not.
