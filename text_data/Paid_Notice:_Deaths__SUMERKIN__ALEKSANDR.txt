        SUMERKIN--Aleksandr. An intellectual influence in the Russian emigre community and in the Village -as well as in the 1960's Moscow, he edited, published, translated, wrote a little, sang, and talked. His quiet charm, taste, courage, and rare dignity will be sorely missed by his close friends of many decades.
