        Re ''Out of Sight'' (column, Dec. 18):
        Bob Herbert writes of thousands of Katrina victims still ''suffering in silence, out of the sight of most Americans.''
        He also notes that ''the government could have come up with a crash program to build housing and find or create jobs for the victims of Katrina.''
        I remember another president faced with a far greater catastrophe. The bleeding-heart liberal Franklin D. Roosevelt raised America from its Depression-era depths with a vast rebuilding program that produced new structures, infrastructures, services and jobs.
        George W. Bush touted himself as a compassionate conservative. Yet his actions and inactions clearly reveal his compassion, indeed -- for the wealthy.
