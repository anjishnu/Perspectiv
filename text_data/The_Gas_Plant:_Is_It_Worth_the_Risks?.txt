        To the Editor:
        Re ''L.N.G. Terminal Gains Momentum'' (editorial, Dec. 3):
        Whether based on science or common sense, criticisms of the Broadwater Energy proposal for a liquefied gas terminal in Long Island Sound are well reasoned.
        Rather than being analyzed in a vacuum, the effects of the Broadwater plan should be examined together with those of other proposed industrial
        activities or as a potential precedent.
        Given the likelihood that the project could pave the way for other industrial uses that could worsen the cumulative adverse effects on the Sound, is it worth the risk?
        And given the fact that the project would increase our reliance on foreign fossil fuel, thereby reducing the region's energy security and increasing
        the potential for price volatility, is it worth the risk?
        Wouldn't it be better to keep the billions of dollars that would be siphoned out of the region by Broadwater here, to be invested in renewable
        energy, energy conservation and efficiency?
