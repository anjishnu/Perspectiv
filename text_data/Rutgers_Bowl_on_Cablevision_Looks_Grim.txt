        Cablevision yesterday told the NFL Network that it would carry the channel's coverage of only the Rutgers-Kansas State Texas Bowl next Thursday on a basic cable channel. The response ignored the network's offer that Cablevision carry a free weeklong preview that would include the bowl.
        The league said it was disappointed that Cablevision, with about 1 million customers in New Jersey, had rejected the preview, and it was unfortunate that Cablevision's customers would miss the game. Without a change in positions, the game will not be shown on Cablevision.
        In its statement, Cablevision said: ''Dealing with the NFL Network is beginning to feel like dealing with Lucy and the football. We haven't turned down anything. What part of 'Yes, we will carry the Rutgers game to 100 percent of our customers' do they not understand?''
        The decision came two days after the NFL Network agreed to let Time Warner carry the preview on its digital basic tier, which 75 percent of its 1.4 million New York-New Jersey customers receive. The companies have refused to make a long-term deal with the network, squabbling over its cost and placement on expanded basic or digital tiers. The preview is the network's chance to show off its programming.
