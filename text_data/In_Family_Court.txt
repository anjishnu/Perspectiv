        Re ''Pataki Goes Far Afield to Find Political Allies for the City Appellate Bench'' (news article, Dec. 9):
        Walk into New York Family Court any day and you will feel just as disgusted as I do that Gov. George E. Pataki's upstate appointees have cost the state a superfluous ''$212,000 in the First Judicial Department to feed, house and transport the transplanted judges and their staffs.''
        Family Court judges are swimming in cases. Families whose children have been removed or who face other dire circumstances must take off from work and invariably wait the entire day for their cases to be called.
        I shudder to think what $212,000 could do in family court.
