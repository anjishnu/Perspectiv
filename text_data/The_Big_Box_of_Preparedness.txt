        A billboard on I-95 in Connecticut asks, ''Does your family have an emergency plan?'' Er, no. Leslie Fastenberg, a self-described soccer mom from Old Westbury, N.Y., steps into the breach with a mammoth (and stylish) emergency kit called the ICE-Qube. The 85-pound box is stocked with enough necessities, she said, for a family of four to survive for four days: $850 plus shipping at (516) 650-7690 or ice-qube.com. Over 100 items are within, like toothbrushes, a crank radio, Jif peanut butter and condoms. I wondered about those last two items. ''What, do you want the peanut butter from Whole Foods instead?'' she said, adding that condoms were a ''high-value, small-mass product.''
