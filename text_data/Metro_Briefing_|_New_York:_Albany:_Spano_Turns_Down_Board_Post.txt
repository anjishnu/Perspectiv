        State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester County Republican who lost his seat to Andrea Stewart-Cousins in last month's election, pulled himself out of the running yesterday for an appointment to the board of the State Public Service Commission, which oversees utilities. Gov. George E. Pataki had been considering appointing Mr. Spano, who leaves office at the end of the month. The potential appointment had concerned Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer and his staff members, who have said they are unsettled by the number of appointments Mr. Pataki is making to boards of public authorities and commissions.
