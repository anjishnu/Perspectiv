        To the Editor:
        Re ''M.T.A. Gets Bill When Armrests Chew Up Pants'' (front page, Dec. 6): So it seems that the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North are practicing a reimbursement policy reflecting that compensation will be limited to the depreciated value (as determined by them) for repayment to commuters victimized by their armrests.
        I respectfully suggest that in all fairness it's incumbent on them to include, with whatever payment, the name and location of at least one retailer of used pants where those receiving reimbursements can purchase identical -- albeit previously owned -- replacements.
