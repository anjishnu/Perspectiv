        A former teacher at a private school in Buffalo who pleaded guilty to sexual abuse for touching the breast of a 15-year-old student was ordered deported yesterday from Canada, where he had planned to serve his sentence of three years' probation under an arrangement approved by a Buffalo judge. The teacher, Malcolm F. Watson, above, a 36-year-old American, had caused a cross-border stir when his plan to serve out the probation with his family in St. Catharines, Ontario, 30 miles northwest of Buffalo, became known to the authorities in Canada. The ruling yesterday, by an immigration board in Niagara Falls, Ontario, ordered Mr. Watson deported because the case constituted sexual exploitation under Canadian law. Mr. Watson has appealed.
