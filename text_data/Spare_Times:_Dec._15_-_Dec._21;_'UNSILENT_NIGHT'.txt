        Calling all musicians -- in this case anyone with a boombox who can press play on cue. In what is now a holiday rite, the composer Phil Kline, above, is giving out cassettes and CDs of his work, ''Unsilent Night,'' to stereo-carrying comers tomorrow evening at the arch in Washington Square Park. Then Mr. Kline will raise a baton to guide participants to pop in the tapes, press play and pump up the volume. At 7 the boombox Christmas parade typically starts working its way eastward as the amplified drones and chimes and bells echo off buildings, stop traffic, baffle passers-by and encourage taxi horns to chime in. The procession ends with a finale at Tompkins Square Park. The 44-minute electronic Christmas carol is a slippery, swirling blizzard of sound that is the soundtrack to ''Unsilent Night,'' an event that began in New York in 1992 and has become a seasonal classic in 15 other cities, from Australia to the Yukon. The score, which has four parts, is meant for ''an infinite number of boomboxes,'' Mr. Kline said, though he's hoping for about 250 to play the work and, if last year is any guide, more than 2,000 to attend. ''When I first started, I just used cassettes, but every year, more people ask for CDs,'' Mr. Kline said. ''I don't know how long boomboxes will be around, but as long as they are, we'll keep doing this.''
