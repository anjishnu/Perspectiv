        Giants' fans have faith. A Robin Hood hero is praying for you.
        The Robin Hood Foundation, a poverty-fighting group in New York, honored four people at its 17th annual ''heroes breakfast'' last week.
        Heroes included Dacia Toll and Doug McCurry, president and superintendent of the charter school group Achievement First; Dr. Hawthorne E. Smith, director of psychology and co-director of the Bellvue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture and Sister Mary Alice Hannon, a nun who runs Part of the Solution, a group that helps the homeless. As might be expected of heroes, they all spoke of others.
        Sister Mary Alice first recalled Desda, a homeless woman who taught her that ''it's not about a warm bed or a hot meal, it's about human dignity.'' But she had hope for others, too. After Tiki Barber, the New York Giants running back who is a member of Robin Hood's leadership council, introduced her, she said: ''Thank you, Tiki. I'll keep praying for the Giants. Miracles can happen.''
