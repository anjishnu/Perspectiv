        Re ''Turkey and the European Union: An Issue Is Cyprus'' (letter, Dec. 7):
        The allegation by the Greek Cypriot representative to the United Nations that ''there is no embargo'' on the Turkish Cypriots can be best answered by the United Nations secretary general. In his Dec. 1 report to the Security Council, the secretary general stressed that he continues to stand by his May 28, 2004, report indicating that the isolation of Northern Cyprus must be lifted.
        If there had not been an isolation of or embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots, why the need for the secretary general to call for lifting of such?
