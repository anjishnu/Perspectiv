        Q. I find that the digestive spirit Fernet Branca often works for me as a digestive aid. Is there any scientific basis for this, or am I just suggestible?
        A. Fernet Branca, an alcoholic after-dinner drink, contains bitter herbs, among other ingredients, and bitter herbs often help digestive problems, though the exact mechanisms are not completely understood, according to a review article by Swiss researchers published in 2001 in the journal Forsch Komplementarmed Klass Naturheilkd.
        When tasted at even small concentrations, bitters seem to act through the nervous system to stimulate the secretions of the stomach and digestive glands as well as to strengthen the contractions of the smooth muscles of the digestive tract.
        ''At higher dosages, bitters probably directly affect the mucous membranes of the stomach and the bowel,'' the review said.
        Bitters often are combined with essential oils that act as local anesthetics and help control spasms and get rid of gas, the researchers say.
        Recent controlled studies conducted with various combinations of bitter herbs and other long-used plant remedies found them superior to placebos, the article said.
        The combinations tested included some with caraway oil, peppermint oil, turmeric extract and ginger extract.
