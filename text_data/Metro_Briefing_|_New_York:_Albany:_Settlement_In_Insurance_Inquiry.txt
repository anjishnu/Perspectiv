        A company that provides health insurance to state government employees and retirees has agreed to correct errors in its directory of physicians and reimburse policyholders for improper bills as part of a settlement with the attorney general's office, state officials announced yesterday. The attorney general opened an investigation after a policyholder complained that she had been billed for a physician's services as outside the company network when the doctor was listed in the company directory, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said. The company, UnitedHealthcare, acknowledged that there were errors in the directory, said Maria Gordon-Shydlo, a company spokeswoman. She said that some physicians had multiple offices, some of which accepted the Empire Plan and some not, but that all offices were listed in the directory. The errors have been corrected, she said.
