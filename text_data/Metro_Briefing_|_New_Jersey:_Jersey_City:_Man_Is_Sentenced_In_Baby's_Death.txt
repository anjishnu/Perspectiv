        A West New York man who twice impregnated his daughter and told her to throw both newborns out a third-story bathroom window -- which she did, killing one -- pleaded guilty yesterday in State Superior Court to aggravated manslaughter, aggravated assault and aggravated sexual assault. The man, Jose Julio Ventura, 45, acknowledged in court that he started having sex with his daughter, Lucila Ventura, now 19, when she was 13. In September 2005, the authorities found a baby boy alive in an air shaft, and the next day they found the body of a newborn girl buried under garbage. A prosecutor, Michael D'Andrea, requested a sentence of 35 years in prison. Ms. Ventura pleaded guilty to reckless manslaughter earlier this year.
