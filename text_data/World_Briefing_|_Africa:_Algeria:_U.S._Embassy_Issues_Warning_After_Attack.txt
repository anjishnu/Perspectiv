        The United States Embassy warned Americans to be on alert to possible attacks after a bombing on Sunday killed the driver of a bus carrying foreign oil workers and injured nine passengers. Four Britons and one American were among those wounded in the attack, the first in years on Western expatriates working in the country. Algerian authorities are still battling a small Islamist insurgency, remnants of the civil war that ravaged the country through the 1990s. Sunday's attack, against employees of Brown & Root Condor, a joint venture of the Halliburton subsidiary KBR, the former Kellogg, Brown & Root, and Condor Engineering, an affiliate of Algeria's state energy company, happened in the upscale Bouchaoui district west of Algiers.
