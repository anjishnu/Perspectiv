        To the Editor:
        While I am glad that Meghan O'Rourke, in her otherwise thoughtful review of ''Up Is Up, But So Is Down: New York's Downtown Literary Scene, 1974-1992'' (Nov. 19), saw fit to quote (however elliptically) my poem ''Lecture on Third Avenue (After V-Effect)'' (''terror is released in Lower Manhattan'') as an example of Downtown writers' distaste for commercialism (specifically, in this case, the then incipient gentrification of the East Village), I am perplexed that neither the title of the poem, nor the fact that it was originally published in the first issue of my little magazine, redtape, nor even the author's name, is acknowledged in the article. These kinds of omissions only serve to further marginalize the marginalized.
        The poem that O'Rourke excerpts was written in 1982, in direct reaction to a song called ''Lecture on First Avenue,'' by the Downtown leftist no-wave band, V-Effect, and as a reaction to controversy surrounding proposed changes in zoning laws, which inevitably led to the construction of the N.Y.U. towers on Third Avenue, and ultimately to the wholesale gentrification of the Lower East Side.
