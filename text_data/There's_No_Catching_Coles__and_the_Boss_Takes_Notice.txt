        The game was over, the Jets had won, 26-13, and Laveranues Coles's back was still throbbing from a late-game hit by Vikings linebacker Ben Leber. Between the sideline and the tunnel to the locker room at the Metrodome, the Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, put his left arm across Coles's shoulders and spoke to him for about 30 seconds.
        On a day when Coles tied his career high with 12 catches and posted his fifth 100-yard game of the season, with 144, he could have used ice on his back more than a pat from the boss. But Coles respectfully stopped and listened.
        ''He just told me he thought I was a really good player,'' Coles said. ''And he just let me know he's pleased to have me on the team.''
        No doubt. Coles shredded the Vikings' pass coverage with a little of everything -- some acrobatic catches, a few nice runs after the catch and one graceful touchdown grab after beating the veteran cornerback Fred Smoot in single coverage. ''Very typical Laveranues,'' Jets Coach Eric Mangini said.
        Coles, referring to himself in the third person, said the game plan ''was a little bit directed toward Laveranues, to try to find the way to get him the ball and get him the ball.'' Like the offensive coordinators of all the other teams that have faced the Vikings in the past seven weeks, the Jets' Brian Schottenheimer chose to challenge the Vikings in the air rather than tangle with their top-ranked run defense.
        ''We've seen teams doing it to them,'' right guard Brandon Moore said. ''New England started it, and then other teams followed suit. That's what we wanted to do -- throw the ball, throw the ball, throw the ball, mix it up a little with a run, then throw the ball.''
        After the first series, when quarterback Chad Pennington fumbled on a blitz to set up a Minnesota touchdown, the Jets gave Pennington enough protection to spread the ball around. And that meant plenty of looks for Coles.
        His four first-quarter receptions came on short routes, designed to slow the Vikings' blitz. Coles lost a shoe on a 14-yard catch to the Vikings' 16 early in the second quarter. Three plays later, he nearly stole a first down with a spin move after a catch that brought the ball to the Vikings' 7. On fourth-and-1, Mike Nugent kicked a 25-yard field goal to give the Jets a 10-7 lead.
        Pennington went back to Coles on the next series. Coles used his size and speed to make a catch and turn upfield against cornerback Antoine Winfield, who hopped in dismay after Coles gained 17 yards to the Minnesota 23. Three plays later, on third-and-8, Coles split left and saw Smoot on him, alone. Coles beat Smoot to the end zone, slowed, then leaped to catch Pennington's lob.
        ''That's one of our things,'' Coles said. ''Any time I have an opportunity against one-on-one coverage, I want the ball. Whether he throws it to me or not is something different. Whenever we're one on one, I always want the ball, I look for the ball.''
        The touchdown catch put Coles over 1,000 yards receiving for the season, his first time eclipsing that mark since his Pro Bowl season of 2003, when he played for the Washington Redskins.
        Coles made an even better catch in the third quarter, reaching back and snatching a possible interception from the fast-closing safety Darren Sharper for a 21-yard gain to the Minnesota 20. That led to Nugent's fourth field goal, a 20-yarder for the Jets' only second-half points.
        ''I think they did a good job mixing up single coverage along with having a safety on the hash,'' Coles said. ''But I didn't expect to see that much single coverage, I must admit. Any time I get alone that much, I'm excited.''
        His 87 catches leave him three short of the career-best 90 he had for Washington in 2004, and 6 from Al Toon's Jets record of 93, set in 1988.
        But Coles was so sore after the game that he needed help stepping down from the podium platform, so he would not stumble and smudge his white three-button sportcoat.
        With about five minutes to play, Napoleon Harris intercepted Pennington, and linebackers Leber and E. J. Henderson converged on Coles, with Leber delivering the jarring hit.
        Coles said that as he lay on the ground, he had one thought: ''Pain.'' After several minutes, he walked gingerly off the field.
        ''You get sandwiched between two linebackers, and I weigh 195,'' he said. ''So it didn't feel good when it happened. But the good news is, I was thankful that I was able to get up and get into the locker room.''
        But first, the boss had something pleasing to tell him. ''It's always good when you hear that coming from the owner,'' Coles said.
