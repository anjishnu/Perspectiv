        GILBERT--Elizabeth Isaacs. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of the first Dean of Students at its Stern College for Women. She was the widow of Dr. Moses L. Isaacs, Professor of Chemistry and former Dean at Yeshiva College. A great-great-grandmother, Mrs. Gilbert was elegant and articulate, and served as a role model for her family and students. Heartfelt condolences to her daughter Nancy Klein, daughter-in-law Sara Isaacs and the entire family. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees Marjorie Diener Blenden Chairman, Stern College Board of Directors
