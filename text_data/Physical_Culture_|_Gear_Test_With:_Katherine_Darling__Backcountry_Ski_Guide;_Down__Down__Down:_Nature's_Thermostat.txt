        LIKE Diddy, down jackets used to be puffy. Now, inspired by the styling seen in synthetic down jackets, outdoor companies are streamlining down jackets through the cut of the garment and stitching patterns called baffling.
        ''As the versatility of synthetic fibers lead to more fashionable looks, manufacturers realized down had to get away from horizontal baffling and get more creative,'' said Stephen Sullivan, a founder of Cloudveil in Jackson, Wyo.
        But more seams can translate into less warmth, since they are points of entry for cold air. Fill power, a metric of how well down performs, affects how toasty a jacket feels, as does the amount of fill in it. So oddly, a jacket that is 650-fill can be warmer than one with 800-fill if the lower-fill jacket contains more down.
        Katherine Darling, a backcountry skiing guide for Sun Valley Trekking, tested these jackets on three days in the Idaho backcountry when the temperature ranged from 8 to 28 degrees. Regulating body heat was her biggest concern, but Ms. Darling also considered details and style, especially when strolling in downtown Sun Valley.
