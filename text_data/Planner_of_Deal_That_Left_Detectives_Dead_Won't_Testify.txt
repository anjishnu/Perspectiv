        A man who arranged to sell a gun to two undercover detectives will not be called to testify against a man accused of killing the detectives as they sought to make the purchase, prosecutors indicated in Federal District Court in Brooklyn yesterday.
        The man on trial, Ronell Wilson, 24, of Staten Island, is charged with shooting the detectives in the back of the head on Staten Island in March 2003. If convicted, he could face the death penalty on several counts, including killing the detectives as a member of a criminal organization.
        The man described as a planner of the transaction, Omar Green, has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for his involvement, agreeing to cooperate with the government in exchange for leniency.
        But Mr. Green has altered his account of whether Mr. Wilson knew that the detectives were police officers, leading prosecutors to drop certain charges against him. In a letter to the court last summer, prosecutors said Mr. Green had described planning to rob the detectives.
        At first, prosecutors wrote, Mr. Green told them Mr. Wilson had said he did not care whether their men were officers and would shoot them if anything went wrong. Later, Mr. Green changed his account, saying Mr. Wilson indicated only that he would ''do what he had to do.''
        Though the issue is no longer legally relevant to the trial, prosecutors have introduced other evidence to show jurors that Mr. Wilson might have known that his victims, Detectives James V. Nemorin and Rodney J. Andrews, were officers. Mr. Green's testimony was also expected to bolster the government's description of the criminal organization it calls the Stapleton Crew. His altered account could also have provided rich opportunities for defense lawyers during cross-examination.
        Mr. Green has remained on the witness list throughout the government's presentation in the past two and a half weeks.
