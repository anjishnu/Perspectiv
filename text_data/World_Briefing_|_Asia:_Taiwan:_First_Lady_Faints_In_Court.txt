        Wu Shu-chen, the wife of President Chen Shui-bian, fainted on the first day of her trial on charges of embezzlement and forgery involving a discretionary presidential fund, and later recovered at a hospital. The trial continued for three presidential aides charged with related offenses, but the prosecution of Ms. Wu, 54, was temporarily suspended. Paralyzed from the waist down since she was hit by a truck in 1985, she is frail and has reportedly been in poor health.
