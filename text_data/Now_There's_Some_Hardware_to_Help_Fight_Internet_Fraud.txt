        It is phishing season. While Forrester Research predicts that online shopping will top $132 billion this year, with a substantial portion of that happening this holiday season, the threat of phishing and other forms of identity theft is also on the rise.
        Zone Labs was one of the first companies to provide personal firewall software to help prevent hacking, spamming and virus attacks. The company has now entered the hardware field with the ZoneAlarm Secure Wireless Router Z100G, which includes all the software needed to help protect your home network from intrusions.
        The unit itself is a standard four-port hub with an 802.11 b/g wireless access point. It also has a built-in print server for sharing a printer over the network.
        But the real advantage of the Z100G is the software, which defends against standard attacks and updates automatically to handle new ones. The unit, available at www.zonelabs.com, is priced at $200 but is now on sale for $150. Updates are free for the first year and $69 a year after that.
        The router includes several functions that are usually found only on models intended for businesses.
