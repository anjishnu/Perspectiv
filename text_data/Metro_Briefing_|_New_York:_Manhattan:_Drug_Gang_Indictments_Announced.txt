        Two rival gangs dealing crack cocaine and PCP, a hallucinogen, near three housing projects in Central and East Harlem have been dismantled after a 22-month investigation, the police and prosecutors said yesterday. The investigation led to the indictment of 43 people on drug charges and 3 on gun charges, officials said. The activity reportedly took place near the Schomburg Towers, the Martin Luther King Jr. Houses and the Taft Houses. Officials said one gang's PCP was packaged in used Gerber baby food jars.
