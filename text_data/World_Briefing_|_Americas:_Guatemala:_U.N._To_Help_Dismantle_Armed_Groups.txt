        The United Nations signed an accord with the government of Guatemala to set up a commission to aid prosecutors in investigating human rights abuses in the country. Prosecutors, rights activists, judges and others have been the targets of attacks by illegal armed groups in Guatemala, which is still recovering from a civil war. The commission, if approved by Guatemala's Congress, would provide assistance in taking on the remnants of armed groups from the war as well as powerful drug traffickers. ''It could be the only hope Guatemala has for finally making headway against lawlessness and impunity,'' said Daniel Wilkinson of Human Rights Watch.
