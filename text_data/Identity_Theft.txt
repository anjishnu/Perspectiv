        Re ''Protectors, Too, Gather Profits From ID Theft'' (front page, Dec. 12):
        Federal law imposes on credit bureaus an obligation to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in credit reports.
        Yet because, as you report, credit bureaus are the biggest beneficiaries of identity theft, they have an incentive to use systems that enable identity theft so they can profit by selling services to prevent it.
        We will not see an end to identity theft until those with the greatest ability to prevent it have an incentive to do so.
