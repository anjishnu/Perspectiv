        ROBBINS--Sara, Professor. The Brooklyn Law School community mourns the loss of Professor Sara Robbins, Director of the Law Library. Over the past two decades, thousands of students, staff and faculty members have benefited from her thoughtful stewardship of the library, her professionalism, and her grace. Her role in making the library one of the nation's most technologically advanced was indispensable, and her mark on Brooklyn Law School is indelible. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family.
