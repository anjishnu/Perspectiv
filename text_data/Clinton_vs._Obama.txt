        Re ''Will Hillzilla Crush Obambi?,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Dec. 13):
        Hillary Clinton versus Barack Obama are in what should be a heated contest for the Democratic presidential nomination. But ''there is a second question, perhaps one that will trump race and gender,'' Ms. Dowd says. ''It's about whether he's tough and she's genuine.''
        Well, having been president of The Harvard Law Review, Mr. Obama is probably pretty tough. On the other hand, if you have to ask if someone is genuine, that's a problem.
        However, it will be the gender thing that will haunt Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama is already drawing crowds as only former President Bill Clinton can. As for his race, Mr. Obama is to politics what Tiger Woods is to golf; they simply transcend the issue.
        In order to win, Mrs. Clinton should not run from her gender, but rather sell it. We have had lots of fathers of the nation; we may be ready for a strong and loving mother.
