        ''Identity,'' NBC's latest game show, in which contestants compete by matching strangers to a list of identities, made its debut on Monday, tying NBC's 8 p.m. game show, ''Deal or No Deal,'' for the night's best ratings among adults 18 to 49. According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Identity,'' which features Penn Jillette as host, drew 12.2 million viewers at 9 p.m., while ''Deal or No Deal'' garnered more total viewers (15.3 million). NBC won the night over all, even as a Christmas-themed repeat of ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' (4.6 million) ranked last in the 10 p.m. hour among adults 18 to 49. A repeat of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (12.3 million) led that hour, and CBS finished second for the night, broadcasting repeats of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10. Fox was third with repeats of ''House'' at 8 (7.6 million) and ''Bones'' at 9 (6.2 million). ABC trailed, in fourth, despite original episodes of ''Supernanny'' at 9 (6.5 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (4.5 million).
