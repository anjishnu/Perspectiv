        Trevor Paglen is one of many contemporary artists who continue to usefully stretch that term. He is a geographer by training, a conspiracy theorist by instinct and an investigative reporter by avocation. And the work in his first solo show at Bellwether is of a piece with his recent book ''Torture Taxi: On the Trail of the C.I.A.'s Rendition Flights.''
        Written with A. C. Thompson, the book is a report on clandestine Central Intelligence Agency activities, including the maintenance of secret military bases with detention facilities, known as black sites, in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Mr. Paglen has photographed some of these sites with high-power, long-range telescopic cameras, ordinarily employed in the study of astronomy, and the results make up most of the show.
        The photographs and video clips of anonymous-looking buildings in parched landscapes shot through a shimmering heat haze seem to emit a buzz of mystery as they turn military surveillance inside out: here the surveillant is surveilled. In addition, Mr. Paglen documents the use of invented corporations and identities as covers for intelligence activity, and he presents everything in an un-gussied-up, unannotated format that borders on bland abstraction.
        We're so used to being fed politics as fantasy entertainment, by art and the media, that we end up never being sure when we're looking at the real thing. ''Black World'' is the real thing, and it's in an art gallery and not on the evening news. Go figure. Or maybe you already have.
