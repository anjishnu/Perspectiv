        A Monmouth County grand jury on Monday declined to indict a Bradley Beach police officer who arrested Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy, left, of Jersey City outside his sister's bar last June, prosecutors said. The mayor said that the officer, Terry Browning, roughed him up while taking him into custody. The grand jury declined to indict the officer, and Officer Browning's lawyer, Charles J. Uliano, said Mr. Healy was ''mistaken and just plain wrong.'' Mr. Healy faces charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and obstruction of justice.
