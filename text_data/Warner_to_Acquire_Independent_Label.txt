        Warner Music Group has struck a deal to purchase a controlling stake in the independently run label Roadrunner for $73.5 million, according to people briefed on the deal.
        The transaction, which is to be announced today, adds a roster of bands like the multiplatinum rock band Nickelback to the Warner Music fold. Roadrunner's releases are to be distributed through Warner Music's Atlantic unit, these people said.
        Warner Music's acquisition of 73.5 percent of Roadrunner Music Group also takes away a source of revenue from Universal Music Group.
        Until now, Universal's Island Def Jam label had shared profits with Roadrunner under a joint venture agreement.
        Roadrunner was founded in 1980 in the Netherlands. The deal would be subject to approval in Germany.
