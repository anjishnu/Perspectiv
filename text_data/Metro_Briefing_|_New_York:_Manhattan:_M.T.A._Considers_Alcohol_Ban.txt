        The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will study a possible ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages on commuter trains and rail platforms, Peter S. Kalikow, the agency's chairman, said yesterday. Mr. Kalikow, left, said the authority would also consider prohibiting passengers from drinking alcoholic beverages that they take onto the trains. Mr. Kalikow said it was his personal view that the authority should limit the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad. While there is a tradition of commuters' buying a drink on homebound trains in the evening, he said, ''The commuter rails are much more crowded than they've ever been, and we need to understand it's a different environment than when these rules were originally promulgated.''
