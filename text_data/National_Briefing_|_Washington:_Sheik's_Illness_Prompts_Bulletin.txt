        The hospitalization of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who is serving a life sentence at a Missouri prison for his role in a 1993 plot to bomb New York City landmarks, prompted the authorities to issue a bulletin saying that he had urged his followers to engage in violence if he died in custody, law enforcement officials said. The officials said they had received no credible threats associated with Sheik Abdel Rahman, a 69-year-old blind Islamic cleric, but sent the advisory Dec. 8 as a precaution, two days after the sheik was transferred to a Springfield, Mo., hospital for a blood transfusion. A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons declined to describe details of the sheik's medical problem or say how long he was hospitalized, but said he was returned to the prison when his condition stabilized.
