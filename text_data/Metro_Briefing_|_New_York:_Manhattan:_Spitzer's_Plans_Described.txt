        Paul Francis, the budget director for Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer, said yesterday that moderate-income housing, health care, government reform and education would be the core of Mr. Spitzer's agenda for the first 100 days after his Jan. 1 inauguration. Mr. Francis cautioned that the issues ''won't be solved in one administration or two.'' Mr. Francis, who spoke at the New School, said Albany's role in expanding housing would grow.
