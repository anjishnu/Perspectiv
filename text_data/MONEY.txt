        Even though Senator Evan Bayh has taken himself out of the presidential race, he still has a considerable asset: more than $10 million in campaign donations. Some donors may ask for the return of their contributions. But Mr. Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, is expected to retain most of them, adding to his appeal as a possible vice-presidential candidate.
        In the meantime, the money stays in his Senate re-election coffer. His seat is up again in 2010. Some strategists have speculated that Mr. Bayh withdrew to avoid spending all his money in a long-shot campaign, thus protecting his viability for the No. 2 slot. But his advisers insist that was not the case.
