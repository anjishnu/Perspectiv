        Re ''Slow is Beautiful'' and ''A Collision Report from Moose-Heavy Maine'' (Dec. 12) : I would suggest that ecopassages could be the answer. These bridges and tunnels for animals allow them to cross the roads we have built through their habitats. Where they have been used, the mortality rate of the animals has been significantly reduced, as has the incidence of traffic accidents caused by the animals. They don't want to have to cross the road, and we don't want them there. Let's give them an option.
