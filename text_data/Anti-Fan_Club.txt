        I have been searching for a good reason to dislike the Internet, and Rob Walker's Nov. 26 Consumed column fits the bill. I don't know why I am so shocked by this phenomenon of a group rallying in cyberspace to proclaim contempt for someone or something. Hey, it's a free market of ideas out there. The Internet isn't exactly a crowded theater, and no one is exactly yelling, ''Fire!''
        Except: I recall my colleague, Rabbi A. A Web-smart bar mitzvah kid didn't like her, and he created an ''I Hate Rabbi A.'' Web site. The site was adolescent and mean-spirited. She prevailed on the teenager (and his parents) to remove the site. They refused.
        Soon afterward, Rabbi A. applied for another position, and when the search committee Googled her, they found the hateful Web site. It was sufficient to end her candidacy.
        The Internet is an unregulated and chaotic jungle that combines usefulness, nonsense, wisdom and sheer bombast. And, sadly, there is nothing that its victims can do about it.
