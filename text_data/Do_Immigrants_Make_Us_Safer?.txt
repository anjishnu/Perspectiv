        Eyal Press's essay (Dec. 3) on the lower crime rates in immigrant communities was thought-provoking. As to why immigrants commit less violent crime, common sense suggests they came here, whether legally or illegally, to work, and they're too busy doing that -- and are too well rewarded by economic opportunities they find here that don't exist in their former countries. Illegal immigrants may be deterred from criminality by the relatively high penalty of deportation for even minor crimes, even when they're innocent of any crime beyond entering the country. The data for minor crimes may be biased by underreporting of victimization suffered by illegal immigrants who, with good cause, fear deportation.
