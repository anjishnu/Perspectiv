        Re ''How Green Was My Rally,'' by Lawrence Downes (The City Life, Dec. 10):
        I'm sorry that Mr. Downes didn't stay for the full meeting of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. If he had, he might have heard Mary, an undocumented immigrant from County Kerry, describe how after her brother's death in a car accident in Ireland, she held a wake without a body in the Bronx because she could not return home.
        He might have heard Samantha relay her elderly parents' heartbreak that their daughter cannot join them again in Dublin this Christmas because she is undocumented.
        He might have also heard that out of 1.2 million green cards issued last year, Ireland got about 2,000, and that there is no legal way for the Irish to emigrate here anymore.
        These are serious issues, and ones that my organization was set up to address. We make no apology for doing so, the same as the Hispanic or any other lobby should make no apology for advocating for its people.
        We have forged a very good working relationship with other ethnic groups through our active membership in Comprehensive Immigration Reform Now, the leading umbrella immigration group.
