        EVERY corner Shirley Satterfield turns in her neighborhood -- home, as she likes to say, to ''the people who kept the people of Princeton going,'' and to six generations of her family -- she bumps into him again.
        ''That's Mr. Hinds's house,'' she said, pointing out the yellow duplex on John Street where Albert Hinds lived until his death in June at 104, and then pointing again on the next block. ''That's his church, and that's where he went to school.''
        Albert Hinds was almost everywhere in Princeton, for almost a third of the town's history. He lived so long and so well and remembered so much that in his final years he was revered as a kind of living monument of the town's deep-rooted black community, even if local drivers knew to give a wide berth to the beige 1988 Mercury Sable with the duct-taped fenders that he drove until he was 103.
        He remembered so much about Princeton, in fact, that Shirley Satterfield thinks Princeton should remember him. She has already named the walking tours she gives of the Witherspoon-Jackson neighborhood in his honor, but she has her eye on something else, too -- the plaza outside the public library on Witherspoon Street, in the middle of the long block that stretches between the main gate of Princeton University and the tightly packed web of narrow streets that was Mr. Hinds's home for a century.
        Princeton is one town that will never have a shortage of worthy people to name things after. Since the new library opened in 2004, there have been proposals to name its broad, inviting, brick-paved public plaza in honor of a certain member of the university's class of 1771 (James Madison) or the onetime resident of 112 Mercer Street (Albert Einstein).
        Neither of them, though, was the grandson of a former slave, or the son of a waiter at one of the university's eating clubs, as Mr. Hinds was. Neither of them helped pave Nassau Street when it was still a dirt road, or drove a horse-drawn carriage to Princeton Junction to pick up train passengers, or shined the shoes of the town's swells, or pumped the pipe organ at Mount Pisgah A.M.E. Church, or exterminated the carpenter ants in the lumber that Palmer Square was built from, or attended the same segregated grammar school as Paul Robeson, or played end for the Princeton High football team, or graduated from Talladega College in Alabama, or ran recreation programs at local playgrounds and the old Colored Y.M.C.A., or served on the zoning board for 20 years, or, well into his 90s, led calisthenics classes for the elderly members of his church.
        ''Any part of Princeton, Mr. Hinds had something to do with it,'' said Ms. Satterfield, a retired guidance counselor whose grandmother taught Mr. Robeson and who lives across the street from her old grammar school.
        She first floated the idea of naming something for Mr. Hinds at his 100th birthday celebration. ''And then at his memorial service, I said it again,'' she said. When she did, she recalled, the sanctuary at Mount Pisgah -- where his old shoeshine box sat in a place of honor that day -- rang with applause.
        She plans to make her case to the Borough Council in January. Princeton Future -- a nonprofit community group whose board she serves on -- endorsed the idea at a recent meeting.
        ''He is certainly so deserving to be remembered publicly in some kind of way,'' said Mildred Trotman, a 20-year council veteran who was selected as the borough's first African-American mayor in 2005. ''But I have no idea how the council will react to such a request.''
        Ms. Satterfield said she would like to see a plaque on the plaza that remembers Mr. Hinds, and, by extension, a community that is often forgotten. ''I have to say that there is a general feeling that the intention has been to move us out, so that the town can be lily-white,'' Mr. Hinds said several years ago in an interview with Sheldon Sturges, a co-founder of Princeton Future.
        And that was why whenever Ms. Satterfield called -- whenever she had a tour to lead, a talk to give, a slide show to present -- he came along, even after he needed a walker.
        ''It used to be that the only time white people came into our neighborhood was to come to the hospital or to pick up the people who worked for them,'' she said. ''It's like there's no other history in Princeton other than Einstein or Drumthwacket or whatever.''
        She was turning another corner now, after pointing out the barber, the old grocery, the Masonic temple, the house where the Robesons lived, the segregated cemetery and then a defunct men's club. ''It was 'Colored Men' spelled backwards,'' Ms. Satterfield said and then tried, unsuccessfully, to pronounce it correctly.
        ''I'm not sure. Mr. Hinds knows it,'' she said, slipping and referring to him in the present tense, which is where she wants him to stay.
