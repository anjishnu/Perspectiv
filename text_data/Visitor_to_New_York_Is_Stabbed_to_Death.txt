        A man from Tennessee who went to Brooklyn to help his aunt move was killed in a baffling stabbing outside her building last night, the police said.
        The man, identified as Justin Carney, 24, came north on Friday with his aunt to help her move into an apartment on East 54th Street in East Flatbush, neighbors there said.
        About 6 p.m. yesterday, neighbors heard yelling from a nearby alleyway, they said, and saw Mr. Carney run from the alley into a nearby building, where he collapsed, bleeding profusely.
        Mr. Carney was stabbed once in the neck, according to investigators. He was taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where he was declared dead on arrival.
        The police were looking for two men who witnesses said were ''dressed in black.'' The police said they did not know what prompted the attack.
        Shari Diandra, 19, who met Mr. Carney over the weekend, said that the trip was his first to New York. She said he had been socializing mostly with younger people in the neighborhood and had gone to the Kings Plaza mall on Sunday.
        ''To come here and lose your life'' was horrible, Ms. Diandra said. ''He didn't even live here.''
