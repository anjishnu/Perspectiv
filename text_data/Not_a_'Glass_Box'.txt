        Re ''The (Naked) City and the Undead'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 26):
        Tom Wolfe, in his essay about the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, dismissively calls the Museum of Arts and Design's new home -- a renovation and recycling of the long-derelict building at 2 Columbus Circle now under way -- a ''glass box.'' On the contrary, the museum is cladding the building in ceramic.
        The design by the architect Brad Cloepfil will result in what the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable, writing in 2004, called an ''enrichment'' of the original building.
        Mr. Cloepfil who, Ms. Huxtable wrote, ''designs with a precise delicacy,'' is making a series of narrow, vertical and horizontal cuts into the structure's once-windowless concrete box.
        These incisions, fitted with fritted glass, will add only 20 percent glass to the facade and allow natural light into the galleries.
        The cuts will also draw the streetscape of the city into the museum, providing visitors with a sense of place in the city.
        We are proud that Mr. Cloepfil's elegant design brings this building back to life and integrates it into the urban fabric of the neighborhood, while at the same time preserving much of the structure's original personality.
