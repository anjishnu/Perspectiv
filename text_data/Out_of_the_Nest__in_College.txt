        Re ''In College, You Can Go Home Again and Again'' (Thursday Styles, Dec. 14):
        When my daughter went to freshman orientation this year, I dropped her off at the station, and started to cry. ''Mom,'' she said, ''I'll see you in two days.'' She was right. And two days later, my husband and I drove up to Yale with all her worldly possessions. Since then we've seen her several times, and I cherish every moment.
        As an advice columnist and a mother with an emptying nest, I know that high school kids work hard at separating themselves from their parents. But how wonderful is it that when they move away, many teenagers come to appreciate their parents.
        As Mark Twain famously said: ''When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.''
        Here's to hard-won harmony.
