        ADAM R. BRONFMAN, an heir to the Bronfman family fortune and the managing director of the Samuel Bronfman Foundation, considers himself a creature of the city, but he left New York, where the family's Seagram liquor business was based, for the peace and serenity of the Southwest. There, he has two homes, in Paradise Valley, Ariz., and Park City, Utah.
        ''I'm from New York; I'm a city boy,'' he told an interviewer from Lifestyles, a philanthropy magazine, last year. ''But the absolute silence of being up there on those unmarked trails, it's almost spiritual.''
        But now, Mr. Bronfman is also planning to set up house with his family in Manhattan, though far from the bustling business district. Last month, Mr. Bronfman signed a contract to buy and combine two apartments on the 10th floor of 170 East End Avenue, a new 19-story glass and stone condominium under construction near East 88th Street and Gracie Mansion.
        Mr. Bronfman agreed to pay more than $7 million for the 4,400-square-foot apartment with five bedrooms and six and a half baths and 10-foot ceilings, according to a real estate executive briefed on the deal. The asking price was $7.2 million.
        Mr. Bronfman is the youngest of five children of Edgar M. Bronfman, a former chief executive of the Seagram Company and current president of the World Jewish Congress.
        He lists his occupation as philanthropist and spends much of time managing the affairs of the New York-based foundation, which has set a goal of ''inspiring a renaissance of Jewish life.'' He did not return several phone messages.
        The condominium, the first Manhattan project of Orin Wilf, a suburban builder of single-family homes and shopping centers, is set to open in the late summer or early fall of 2007. About 55 percent of the condos are now reported to be in contract.
