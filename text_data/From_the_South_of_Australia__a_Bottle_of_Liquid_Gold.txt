        Yellingbo, a nature reserve in southern Australia, is adjacent to olive groves that Howard Meltzer planted more than 10 years ago. Mr. Meltzer and his son, Jeremy, are now selling Yellingbo Gold oils from the 2006 harvest that will hold their own when drizzled on fish or vegetables. The unfiltered black label Limited Release version has more pronounced fruitiness. Both are kosher. The regular oil is $17.99 and the Limited Release is $19.99 for 16.75 ounces at Whole Foods; at Citarella the regular is $16.99 and the Limited Release $19.99. The Limited Release is $25 at worldsfoods.com. Five percent of the profits are donated to the Jasmine Foundation, which helps children orphaned in the tsunami in 2004. The Meltzers were among the founders.  FOOD STUFF
