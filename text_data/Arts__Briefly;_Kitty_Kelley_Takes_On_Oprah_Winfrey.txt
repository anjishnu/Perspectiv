        Crown Publishers has acquired the rights to a biography of Oprah Winfrey, below, by the author Kitty Kelley, who has written unauthorized biographies of the Bush family, Nancy Reagan, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and the British royal family. Crown, an imprint of Random House, has not set a release date or title for the book but promised in a statement that Ms. Kelley ''plans to interview hundreds of sources, many of whom have never before spoken on the record about her subject.'' Financial terms were not disclosed.
