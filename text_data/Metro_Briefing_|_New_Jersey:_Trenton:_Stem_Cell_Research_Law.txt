        New Jersey cleared the way yesterday for the construction of stem cell research centers around the state when Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed legislation authorizing $270 million for new medical laboratories. The law calls for the creation of labs devoted to stem cell research in New Brunswick and Newark, a cancer research center in Belleville, and a biomedical research lab in Camden. In addition to the $270 million, Mr. Corzine said that he supported a referendum scheduled for November in which voters would be asked to approve an additional $230 million.
