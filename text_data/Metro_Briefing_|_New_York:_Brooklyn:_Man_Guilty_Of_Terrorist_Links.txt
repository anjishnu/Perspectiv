        A man was convicted yesterday of providing financial support to a terrorist group in India, federal prosecutors said. The verdict against the man, Khalid Awan, 44, came after a two-week trial in Federal District Court. He faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison, said Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. Mr. Awan was charged with sending money to the group, Khalistan Commando Force, a terrorist organization advocating the creation of a separate state in the Punjab region of India, prosecutors said. During the trial, prosecutors played recordings of telephone calls that Mr. Awan -- jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center on charges of credit card fraud -- had made to the group's leader in India, Ms. Mauskopf said.
