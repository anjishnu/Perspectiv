        Tom Gregory, a television personality best remembered in New York for his catchphrase at the beginning of the 10 p.m. WNEW newscast -- ''It's 10 p.m. Do you know where your children are?'' -- died here on Monday. He was 79.
        His death, of heart disease, was confirmed by his daughter Linda Stelzen, who said he first used the phrase in the 1960s when he was anchor of the news program ''Faces and Places in the News'' at WNEW, which was then an independent station broadcasting on Channel 5 in New York.
        It continues to this day on the 10 p.m. Fox newscast that succeeded ''Faces and Places'' in 1967.
        Mr. Gregory began his broadcasting career in radio while studying at Seton Hall University in New Jersey shortly after World War II. After he received a bachelor's degree in communications, he was hired by the New York radio station WPAT.
        In the 1950s he was host of the children's shows ''Cartoon Playtime'' and ''Wonderama,'' then was a guest master of ceremonies on ''The Sandy Becker Show'' and appeared on other shows, including ''The Soupy Sales Show'' and ''Captain Kangaroo.'' He also made commercials.
        Later he was the host of ''Faces and Places in the News.''
        His on-camera career was ended by a violent mugging; his injuries required more than 200 stitches and, eventually, extensive plastic surgery. He became an announcer for the station, which was bought by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1986 and is now part of the Fox network.
        Mr. Gregory was born on July 26, 1927, in Charleston, S.C., and enlisted in the Navy in 1944 at 17.
        In addition to his daughter Linda, Mr. Gregory is survived by his wife of 57 years, Patricia; another daughter, Kathleen Lee, of Port Charlotte, Fla.; a son, Jim Gregory, of Casco, Me.; a brother, John Gregory, of Sarasota; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
