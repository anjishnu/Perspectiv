        Two private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, are in early talks to acquire U.S. Foodservice, the American unit of the Dutch food retailer Ahold, people with knowledge of the talks said yesterday. The deal would value the unit at more than $5 billion.
        Ahold said last month that it would sell the unit, which distributes bulk food to cafeterias, as part of a major shift back to its retailing roots. People with knowledge of the talks said a deal was probably still weeks away. Ahold, one of the largest food retailers in the United States and Europe, promised to use the proceeds from the sales to return at least 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) to shareholders and to reduce debt.
