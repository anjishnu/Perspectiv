        Re ''Fiery Hair vs. Pointy Nose: Seasonal Smackdown Returns'' by Stuart Miller [Dec. 10]:
        If the plot of ''The Year Without a Santa Claus'' (a k a ''that Heat Miser and Snow Miser show'') is difficult to recall, that may be because it's more overwrought than forgettable (Mr. Miller's term). When Santa doesn't feel like going out that year, the obvious solution -- send Mrs. Claus (voiced by the great Shirley Booth) in his place -- is for some reason immediately rejected. And during the era of women's lib, yet. If you want to talk forgettable, look at the current crop of holiday offerings. In a time of global warming, Heat Miser doesn't seem like such an outrageous concept after all.
