        Gangs of Kabukicho  Andrew Roth  160A East 70th Street  Through Dec. 22
        Kabukicho in the East Shinjuku section of Tokyo began its life as a swamp. By the time Watanabe Katsumi arrived, the swamp had been filled in and the area, named after a Kabuki theater that was never built, was a well-established red-light district filled with hostess bars, ''love hotels'' and nightclubs. Denizens called it ''Sleepless Town.''
        The black-and-white photos in ''Gangs of Kabukicho,'' taken between 1966 and 1980, feature various Kabukicho characters, from actual gangsters to drag-queen geishas, pimps, johns, rent boys, transsexuals and prostitutes posing together like sorority sisters.
        With their focus on subjects culled from the urban demimonde and framed in the center of the image, the photographs recall Diane Arbus's work from roughly the same era. But where Arbus was frequently criticized for exploiting her subjects, Mr. Watanabe, who died earlier this year, catered to his milieu, selling his pictures back to his subjects in an attempt to eke out a meager living.
        This lack of detachment might explain in part why Mr. Watanabe's images don't possess the same complicated and complex power as Arbus's. But the photos serve as interesting documents of Kabukicho during its seedy heyday. The parade of street fashion, with girls in go-go boots, tattoo enthusiasts and Japanese James Cagneys, foreshadows more recent interest by other photographers in another style-obsessed Tokyo hot spot, Harajuku. And it's hard not to be affected by Mr. Watanabe's subjects, whose expressions range from joyful to heartbreakingly abject.
