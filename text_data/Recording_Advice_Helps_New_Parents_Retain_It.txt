        Parents who have just had a premature baby are often in no shape to take in the overwhelming amount of information doctors are giving them.
        So doctors in Australia have come up with a simple idea: tape recording the consultations and giving families a copy of the tape.
        The practice, described in a study published online in the British Medical Journal, lets parents review the advice at will, perhaps when they can focus on it better, researchers said.
        They can also listen to it as often as they want and play it for other family members.
        The study was conducted by doctors at a neonatal intensive care unit in North Queensland who divided 200 women who had just given birth prematurely into two groups.
        For one group, the doctors were taped as they talked to the mothers, and the mothers were given the tape and a tape recorder to take home.
        Ten days later, all the mothers were surveyed about how much they recalled about what the doctors had told them.
        The mothers were reinterviewed four months later.
        Those who had the tapes remembered much more than the women who did not have them, six of whom could not even recall the conversation.
        The approach could also have benefits for other medical practices. The researchers noted that other studies had found that cancer patients given tapes of their initial discussions with their doctors reported less anxiety and distress.
        Successful taping, the study said, depends on three factors: a good tape recorder, a quiet room for the health care workers and the mother to talk and the doctor's use of clear and concise language.
