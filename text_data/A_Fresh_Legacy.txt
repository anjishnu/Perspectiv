        Re ''An Edwardian Drama Gets a Mametian Makeover'' [Dec. 10]:
        I am thrilled to see the brilliant playwright Harley Granville Barker receiving attention, but I must take exception to Charles McGrath's characterization of contemporary productions of his plays as having ''a whiff of musty drawing room and mothballed frock coat.'' Earlier this year the National Theater in London presented ''The Voysey Inheritance'' without the aid of any ''plastic surgery.'' The Daily Telegraph wrote that ''the play feels as up-to-date as tomorrow's headlines.'' As artistic director of the Mint Theater Company and producer of ''Voysey'' in New York in 1999, I can assure you that neither audiences nor critics found the play ''creaky.'' The New York Times wrote, ''At the end many people expressed surprise that they had been sitting enthralled for three hours.''
