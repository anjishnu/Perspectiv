        To the Editor:
        As one of only a handful of two-time graduates of the Citizens' Police Academy run by the New York Police Department, I must concur with Gabriel Cohen ('' 'I Know What It's Like to Shoot an Unarmed Man,' '' New York Observed, Dec. 10).
        Unless you have been in a police officer's shoes, it is impossible to understand all the factors -- psychological, emotional, biochemical and so on -- that contribute to the split-second decision by an officer to fire his gun.
        Although all the facts have not yet been established in the death of Sean Bell, and mourning his death is right and proper no matter what occurred, we tend to forget that police officers are also human beings who feel fear. Their bodies react to that fear with an adrenaline rush that can affect decision making and action, just as it would any of us.
        This is not meant as an apology for the police or even an excuse for them if procedures were not followed or preventable wrongful actions were taken. It is simply something that tends to get lost in the emotions of the moment.
        I highly recommend the 13-session Citizens' Police Academy course. It gives an instructive view of what New York City's police officers face each day and how and why they act and react the way they do in various situations.
