        Re ''Desperately Seeking Ethics,'' about the Mark Foley scandal (editorial, Dec. 9):
        What is so difficult about re-establishing strong ethics for House members, who are supposed to represent the citizenry?
        It is disappointing to hear that a bipartisan committee can't seem to get this message! The newly Democratic House needs to get its act together, or it will find itself in the same boat that the departing Republicans are in.
        We are watching.
