        Re ''Beyond Medicine, a Doctor's Urge to Save a Patient from Herself'' (Cases, Dec. 12): Dr. Alex Friedman's thesis, while apparently serving as devil's advocate, treads perilously close to paternalism.
        Medical ethics are based on four principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and recognition of patient autonomy. This 20-something woman, about to have her third child, is an adult who knows her own limitations, emotionally, physically and financially. Dr. Friedman's actions, while done, I'm sure, in good faith, lack respect of patient autonomy. A physician must certainly make a patient aware of the near-finality of her decision, but in the end, it is the patient's choice.
