        Something else they don't tell you in school is that life can be a lot like a textbook. It's a slog mostly, and it's tough to tell the difference between what's important and what's the Warren G. Harding administration. Currently, the teaching of the past for people in the middle school years relies heavily on the use of terms like ''Shays' Rebellion'' and ''checks and balances,'' terms you memorize and explain. It's history as checklist -- which is what makes James M. McPherson's ''Into the West'' seem so brilliantly serene, with slow considerations of an era of American history that is as important as it is overlooked.
        Reconstruction is usually a blip on the screen of young people's history classes, a quick stop in the race from the Civil War to World War I. But in the non-semester-based world, Reconstruction is a hotbed of historical scholarship. Industrial America was in its infancy, and the West was being won, as well as lost, mined and marketed, by the railroads, the interstates of their day. Racism continued to pull the United States apart at the seams while the war-modernized Northern economy began pushing the country west -- and pushing an idea of the West that still shows up in car commercials.
        ''As a boy I watched dozens of western movies starring Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy, which were filled with myths,'' writes McPherson, the Pulitzer-winning author. ''When I grew up and became a historian, it was surprising to learn the realities of the West, which I have tried to present to you in this book.''
        The realities are about development and politics, starting with the Homestead Act, one of Lincoln's most far-reaching legislative measures. Before the Civil War, the government had been hindered in its attempts to settle the land Thomas Jefferson bought; Northern states wanted to limit the expansion of slavery in the new territory, but the South did not. After the war, federal troops were an occupying force in the war-devastated cities south of the Mason-Dixon line, and into the vacuum of political power came the anarchist Ku Klux Klan (whose members dressed up as ghosts of Confederate soldiers) and the carpetbaggers, mostly former Union officers who, according to McPherson, were not what the Southerners who understandably hated them said they were. ''Most carpetbaggers and scalawags proved to be men of great bravery and idealism, who possessed the courage of their convictions to promote necessary social changes.''
        Like good newspaper stories, McPherson's chapters convey big ideas with the details of people's lives, national trends with local notes. ''The prejudice against colored soldiers seems to be without foundation,'' a Montana newspaper reported on the Buffalo Soldiers, the African-American military units nicknamed by Native Americans who likened their hair to that of the buffalo. ''There are no better troops in the service.'' (Indeed, the Buffalo Soldiers had a lower desertion rate than white soldiers and a higher re-enlistment rate.)
        There might have been a chapter about the beginning of the exploitation of the territories (for mining and logging, among other things) or another about how the 14th Amendment became the protector of corporations. But McPherson gets extra credit for highlighting the idea throughout that labor made the West. ''Little Baz can run all over, fetch up cows out of the stock fields, or oxen, carry in stove wood and climb in the corn crib and feed the hogs and go on errands down at his grandma's,'' writes a Kansas settler. Little Baz, McPherson notes, was 2.
        The photographs in this book deliver the reality of the times with a devastating sepia-toned IMAX punch. See the sod house in Nebraska, with leather-skinned father, a row of precious watermelons, a mother holding a squirming kid. See the glint in the real-life eye of Robert LeRoy Parker, a k a Butch Cassidy, with his bowler hat and gold watch and chain. See the fugitive slaves fording a stream, led by four ill-fed oxen and a barefoot boy on horseback, who stares warily into the camera as the men work the oxen that pull a wagon filled with barrels and women hiding from the sun. See the blur of headdresses and moccasins as Indians perform a ghost dance before the Battle of Wounded Knee. Read the caption on Page 86: ''Big Foot, leader of the Sioux, lies frozen in the battlefield where he died.''
        Robert Sullivan is the author, most recently, of ''Cross Country,'' a book about the history of the roads and highways of America.
