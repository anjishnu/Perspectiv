        The 192-member General Assembly unanimously adopted an international treaty protecting the rights of the estimated 650 million disabled people in the world. The convention, which must be ratified by 20 nations to come into effect, covers civil and political rights, accessibility and the unrestricted right to education, health and employment. Ratifying nations must adopt laws prohibiting discrimination. ''We have now reached a global consensus: The disabled are entitled to the full range of civil rights that those without disabilities enjoy,'' said Haya Rashed al-Khalifa of Bahrain, the president of the Assembly.
