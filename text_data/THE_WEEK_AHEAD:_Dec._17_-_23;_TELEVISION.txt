        It just wouldn't be the holiday season without a television movie about someone who discovers the true meaning of love and family at Christmastime. This week's prime example, ''A PERFECT DAY'' (Monday, 8 p.m., TNT), stars ROB LOWE as an author who gets all carried away with himself when his first novel is a megasuccess. PAGET BREWSTER (she was Hank Azaria's wife on ''Huff'') plays his flawlessly supportive, long-suffering wife. FRANCES CONROY (from ''Six Feet Under'') is the flawlessly supportive agent whom most writers would kill to have. Needless to say, the denouement takes place in a churchyard as a light snow falls.
        Over on CBS, the focus is on real-life happy endings. On the eighth annual special ''A HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS'' (Friday at 8 p.m.), this one with Rod Stewart's name appended to the title as host, a batch of celebrities (among them VIRGINIA MADSEN and CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER) talk about the joys of foster care and adoption. Real families make appearances to share their happy situations. Mr. Stewart, JOHN LEGEND, KATHARINE McPHEE and other musicians perform.
        ''IDENTITY,'' NBC's new prime-time game show, could be much worse. At least when contestants face a dozen total strangers on this series, they're trying to guess more than how much money is in their briefcases. They're trying to match the 12 people with 12 traits (occupation, I.Q., sleeping habits, net worth and the like), and each right answer is one step closer to the $500,000 grand prize. Contestants will be called on to use perception and judgment. What a concept -- and shades of ''To Tell the Truth,'' back in the golden age of game shows! The network is showing ''Identity'' five nights in a row, beginning on Monday at 9. The celebrity host is PENN JILLETTE of the comedy-magic team Penn and Teller. (Yes, Mr. Jillette is the one who talks.)
