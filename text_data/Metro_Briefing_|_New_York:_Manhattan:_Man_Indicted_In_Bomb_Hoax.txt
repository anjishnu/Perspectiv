        A man was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday after the authorities said he sent an e-mail message to The Associated Press claiming to have built a bomb to protest illegal surveillance by the government. The man, Paul Cortina, 33, of Somers, N.Y., sent the e-mail message on Nov. 28 and included his name and telephone number, according to court papers. An F.B.I. agent went to his house the next day and found a grenade shell inside a backpack with wires running from the shell to the backpack's zipper but with no explosive material, the United States attorney's office said. Mr. Cortina could face up to five years in prison if convicted of conveying false information about an explosive device, prosecutors said.
