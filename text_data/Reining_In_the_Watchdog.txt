        One of the many areas of government neglect that needs urgent fixing is the lack of supervision of dollar burners like the Iraq war and homeland security: the Pentagon says it has 100,000 civilians now in Iraq on government contracts. Yet the new head of the General Services Administration -- an executive agency that manages over $55 billion in contracts for Iraq, homeland security and other areas -- is intent on cutting the budget of her agency's inspector general.
        The inspector general is one of the independent watchdogs created by Congress to make sure taxpayers get their money's worth from mammoth agencies like the G.S.A. But the G.S.A. chief, Lurita Alexis Doan, plans a $5 million cut for the inspector's office, aiming to replace some government auditors with hires from the private sector. Ms. Doan, who was appointed by President Bush, arrived from the private sector herself as a dynamic company executive vowing to wield a cost-effective broom.
        Nice to hear. But privatizing oversight of private contractors is no way to protect taxpayers. Indeed, the inspector general has become an increasingly endangered species all over Washington. Congressional Republicans penciled out the budget line for another independent watchdog they found embarrassingly effective in tracking major corruption in Iraq reconstruction. Once discovered, the departing Congress withdrew the knife. The G.S.A.'s boss had better sense what's in the air.
