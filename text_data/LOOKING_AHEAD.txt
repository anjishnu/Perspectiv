        MERRY, INDEED With one week to go before Christmas and two weeks before New Year's Day, there are still bonuses and earnings to be awarded and announced on Wall Street, but already there have been a lot of merry tidings. Last week Morgan Stanley said that it was giving its chairman and chief executive, John J. Mack, right, $40 million in stock and options for 2006. Tomorrow, Morgan Stanley will present its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, with profit expected to be up sharply, as it has been at the other big investment houses.

Other reports will include November housing starts (Tuesday); Conference Board leading economic indicators (Thursday); and November durable goods, November personal income and spending, and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index (Friday).
