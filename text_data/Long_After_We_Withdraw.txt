        Drawing parallels between America as Vietnam's ''leading trading partner'' today and Iraq 30 years from now is wishful thinking (David Rieff, Nov. 26). Iraq is more likely to look to China for trade and business. Just as China is Vietnam's historic rival, America's imperial misadventure in Iraq has made it Iraq's. The wounds inflicted upon Iraq will not scab over quickly; little is forgiven or ever forgotten there. In Iraq ''the long march of history'' is measured not in decades but in centuries.
