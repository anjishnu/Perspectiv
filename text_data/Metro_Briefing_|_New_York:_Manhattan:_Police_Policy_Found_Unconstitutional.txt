        A jury in Federal District Court found yesterday that a police policy applied to demonstrators arrested for minor offenses between May 1 and mid-July 2001 was unconstitutional. In a case presented by some 360 plaintiffs, the jury agreed with lawyers who argued that senior police officials had issued orders for demonstrators arrested on minor charges to be put through a long processing, including a night in jail. The jury found that the police treated the demonstrators more harshly than they did nondemonstrators arrested on the same kind of charges, but rejected a claim that about 300 had been unfairly treated under an unwritten practice dating from 1999. Alan Levine, a plaintiffs' lawyer, said negotiations on behalf of about 30 clients eligible for damages under the verdict would begin soon.
