        New Jersey education officials are looking at 40 schools in 25 districts that reported unusually large gains or drops in state test scores, which were released yesterday. The schools, which were not identified, have been sent letters requesting more information about their programs, curriculums, student demographics and testing practices to determine whether cheating or other factors like improved teaching could have caused the changes, said Kathryn Forsyth, a spokeswoman for the State Education Department.
