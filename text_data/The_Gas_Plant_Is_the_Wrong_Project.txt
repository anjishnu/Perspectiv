        Re ''L.N.G. Terminal Gains Momentum'' (editorial, Dec. 3):
        The future of Long Island Sound was dealt a harsh but not unexpected blow by the release of the federal government's draft environmental impact statement on Broadwater Energy's proposal to construct a liquefied natural gas terminal.
        Even though the report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission states that Broadwater could cumulatively affect water quality, marine resources, visual resources, air quality and marine transport, the report gives hope to oil rigs, natural gas facilities and any other industrial complexes that might despoil this national treasure, a treasure we have spent more than a billion dollars restoring.
        The facts demonstrating that Broadwater is not needed were highlighted last March when members of Congress and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment released an analysis illustrating that this is the wrong project in the wrong place at the wrong time.
