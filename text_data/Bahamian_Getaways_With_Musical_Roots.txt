        While Mick Jagger has been known to spend New Year's Eve partying at Basil's Bar near his home in Mustique in the Grenadines, this year the best place to spot rock 'n' roll revelers could be the new Compass Point hotel in Nassau, the Bahamas (800-688-7678; www.islandoutpost.com), owned by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records.
        Just down the road from the legendary Compass Point Studios, where U2, Shakira and others have made recordings, the hotel opened Dec. 1 after a yearlong renovation, just in time for the Junkanoo parades on Dec. 26 and Jan. 1.
        Compass Point, which as of mid-December still had rooms available during the holiday week, has a beachside pool, a restaurant and a bar, as well as 18 brightly painted huts, two-story cottages and cabanas (left). Rooms start at $270 a night.
        Although Bob Marley was more associated with his native Jamaica than with the Bahamas, he owned a home in Nassau, which his widow, Rita, is opening as the Marley Resort in early February. Rooms will have Bose stereos -- better for listening to Bob's music. See www.marleyresort.com.
