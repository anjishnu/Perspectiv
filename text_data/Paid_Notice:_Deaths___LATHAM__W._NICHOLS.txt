        LATHAM--W. Nichols. Nick spent his life as a father, farmer, engineer, conservationist and humanitarian, but always in the service of improving the quality of life of others. During his tenure as director of Camp Kabeyun, a summer camp for boys which he loved dearly, Nick had a profound impact on so many who grew from childhood to manhood. Words cannot fully express the extent and value of his contribution to the Kabeyun community. We extend our sincere condolences to the Latham Family.
