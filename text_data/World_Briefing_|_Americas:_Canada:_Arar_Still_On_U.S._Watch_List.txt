        Maher Arar, the Canadian the United States sent in 2002 to Syria, where he was tortured for months, remains in a database of terrorist suspects maintained by the United States, despite a two-year Canadian investigation that found him to be innocent of any terrorist ties this year. David H. Wilkins, the American ambassador, acknowledged the continued listing of Mr. Arar on Canadian radio. In a later statement issued by the embassy, Mr. Wilkins said that the Canadian inquiry ''was not privy to our information'' and that the decision to include Mr. Arar on the list and to keep his name there were both ''based on information from a variety of sources.'' He said a lawsuit Mr. Arar has brought against the United States prevented him from providing further details.
