        In a lawsuit filed yesterday against the federal government, the state is seeking payment for the cleanup of a former nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in western New York, state officials said. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court, asks the court to order the federal Department of Energy to pay for the disposal of what was originally 600,000 gallons of highly radioactive nuclear waste, said David Munro, an assistant attorney general. State officials estimate that the cost of disposing of the material at a planned federal waste depository will be $228 million. That does not include the additional cost to clean up the site, at West Valley in Cattaraugus County. In a statement yesterday, the Energy Department said it was committed to fulfilling its legal responsibilities regarding the site.
