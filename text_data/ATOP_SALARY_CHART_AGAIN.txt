        It came as no surprise when the players union released its annual average salary report yesterday that said the Yankees were No. 1 for the eighth straight year. Surprising, however, was that the Yankees' average salary this year dropped from 2005.
        The decline was not a first in recent years for the high-spending Yankees; their average fell in 2003. But any time the Yankees have lower salary figures of any kind, it is a development worth noting.
        The Yankees' average was $6,947,232, down from $7,386,451, a decline of 6 percent. They were one of 12 clubs whose average salaries fell, though the major league average rose 9 percent, to $2,699,292 from $2,476,589.
        Because of the number of players on their roster and disabled list as of Aug. 31, the date both the union and the commissioner's office use for their computations, the Yankees' payroll was actually higher this year than last by $717,894 -- $222,311,424 (32 players) to $221,593,530 (30 players).
        Probably an even bigger surprise in the report than the drop in the Yankees' average was the identity of the team with the second-highest average. The Houston Astros' average salary soared 47 percent, to $4,283,240 from $2,905,946.
        The Red Sox were third, down from second, at $3,986,768, and the Mets were fourth, up from fifth, at $3,859,172. The Mets' average rose 15.6 percent; the Red Sox' fell 4.4 percent.
        At the bottom of the average list, not surprisingly, were the Florida Marlins at $594,722. The Marlins, whose average plummeted 68 percent, and their fellow Florida franchise, Tampa Bay ($747,536), were the only teams whose averages were under $1 million.
