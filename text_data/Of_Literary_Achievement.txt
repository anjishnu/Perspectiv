        Re ''Another Encore for the Most Adaptable of Authors'' [Dec. 10]:
        Charles McGrath's enlivening summary of Hollywood's long attraction to W. Somerset Maugham is marred only by his endorsement of the old canard that Maugham was, at his best, a second best. While he was not James or Joyce or Conrad -- how many are? -- Maugham's achievement was substantial. He was a master of the modern short story whose works, as opposed to Chekhov's, invariably had conclusive endings. Mr. McGrath is right to say that he was a kind of writer that scarcely exists today. Why that tradition disappeared is another story. And anyone who could write ''Of Human Bondage,'' well, he can rest on his own plaudits.
