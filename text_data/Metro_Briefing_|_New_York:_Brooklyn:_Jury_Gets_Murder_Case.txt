        Jurors deliberated for six hours yesterday on the fate of a man accused of killing two undercover police detectives on Staten Island in 2003. The man, Ronell Wilson, 24, of Staten Island, could face the death penalty if he is convicted of murdering the detectives to aid a drug-dealing enterprise prosecutors call the Stapleton Crew. The victims, Detectives James V. Nemorin and Rodney Andrews, were seeking to buy a gun from the group in a transaction that prosecutors charge shifted from sales to robbery to murder. After a three-week trial in Federal District Court, including six hours of bitter closing arguments, jurors asked to review testimony from confessed accomplices.
