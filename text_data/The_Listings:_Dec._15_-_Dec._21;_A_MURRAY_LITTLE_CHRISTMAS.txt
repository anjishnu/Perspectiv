        Nothing says Christmas like woozy entertainers, questionable skits and off-color jokes. And this year, in what the gender-bending comedian Murray Hill, above, is calling the Miracle on 14th Street, his downtown extravaganza, ''Murray Little Christmas,'' is moving on up to Comix. The expansive stage at Comix does mean the return of something miraculous: Mr. Hill on ice. ''I'm doing a full four-minute dance routine to 'The Nutcracker.' There's jumping, twirls -- luckily, we're only doing two shows, so I won't break my back,'' Mr. Hill explained recently. ''It's very much like a floor routine in gymnastics, and I'm going to be doing that with my skates.'' Expect awkwardness, jazz hands and provocative costuming. ''I may put on some red tights for this one,'' Mr. Hill said. ''I might show a little leg for the kids. It's uptown.'' Mr. Hill will be joined by many of the usual suspects, including the Wau Wau Sisters, Sebastian the Elf and, of course, Santa. The burlesque Pontani Sisters will perform a tap routine, ''Sleigh Ride,'' and Mr. Hill, Dirty Martini and Lance Cruce will break out the Rang Dang Doo, as taught to them by Stephen Clark of the Clark Brothers. ''It's a show for the whole family, whatever family means to you,'' Mr. Hill said. ''Maybe they want to cover their eyes for the tights. They're a little too young for that. And if they have any heart problems, the older people should look away.'' If you want to get an idea of what you're in for, check out Mr. Hill's TV debut at logoonline.com.
