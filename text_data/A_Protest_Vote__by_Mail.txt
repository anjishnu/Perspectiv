        Re ''The Election Is in the Mail,'' by Ruth Goldway (Op-Ed, Dec. 6):
        Those who fear that electronic voting machines will not count their vote, or, worse, allow someone else to give their vote to a different candidate, can protest by boycotting the polls.
        As more of us send absentee ballots, the message will come through loud and clear: Put a system in place that makes democracy possible.
