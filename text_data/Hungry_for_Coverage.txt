        If any more evidence was needed that the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina will play a prominent role in Democratic efforts to take back the White House, it has arrived. Former Senator John Edwards will announce his second presidential bid next week in the storm-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans.
        Mr. Edwards has made addressing poverty central to his campaign and sees this as a way to dramatize what he argues have been White House failures.
        More perplexing, at least from a conventional point of view, is why Mr. Edwards would announce his candidacy in the last week of the year, a dead time for news, when it can be hard to win voters' attention.
        Democrats said his campaign was gambling that the television networks and cable news programs would find New Orleans a compelling setting in a week when they were desperate for news and when many Americans would be in front of their television sets, albeit looking for football more than politics.
        Unconventional announcements are conventional for Mr. Edwards. In 2004, he made his announcement on Jan. 2. That, of course, didn't work out so well for him.
