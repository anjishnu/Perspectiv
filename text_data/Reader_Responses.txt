        Below are excerpts of reader responses to David Leonhardt's Dec. 20 column on the surge in births at the end of the year:
        I think one of the reasons not mentioned in your article why births are brought forward from January is that maybe people have met their insurance deductible for the year and so it is much less costly to give birth in the last week of December than the first week of January.

        As the mother of a daughter born on Dec. 31 (her actual due date), I read your story with a smirk on my face. My 7-year-old son was born in 1999 on his actual due date, but we didn't really expect the same of my daughter in 2002. When it became clear she wasn't coming early, we did ask the doctor to help things along so we could take advantage of the tax break.
        The day before her due date, he stripped the membranes during my weekly exam and within an hour my contractions were five minutes apart. Out she came at 7:30 a.m. on New Year's Eve - just in time to make the tax deadline. Like your mom, I also did not want to have her come late on New Year's Day and risk being the "first baby of the new year" - who the heck wants TV cameras and newspaper photographers in your face right after labor?!

        I learned at very early age how unfortunate the date and timing of my birth were. Had I been born a few hours earlier -- on December 31st, rather than January 1st -- my parents could have claimed me as a tax deduction for the entire previous year. Had I been born an hour or so earlier, I would have been the first baby born in the city that year. So, I had the dual misfortune of neither providing an additional tax deduction for the previous year, nor of being the first of the new year, and winning for my parents free diaper service, baby clothes, and all the other goodies that came with that honor!

        My son was born last year on Dec. 30th (Friday), and the hospital was packed that day. I literally got the last room (I don't know what they did with the woman who arrived 2 minutes later!) and after my son was born, my doctor delivered two more babies that same hour. I was induced, although it wasn't for tax reasons: my doctor recommended it. But I was fully aware of the tax deduction, since my first child shares your birthday Jan. 1st. I was just glad neither was born on Christmas!

        I am baffled. Your chart shows nine days before the end of the year, averaging about 10,250 births per day and 10 days of the new year averaging 11,500 births per day. Yes, the single highest day occurred just before New Years, but the total births appear to weigh in on the wrong side of the calendar. As I result, I carry away a sense that the article intends to prove something, but may wind up proving something else entirely - such as most people have poor aim and cannot count to 40 weeks as well as they would like. Or that the baby deduction does not matter all that much in the overall scheme of things. What does it compare to when you add in 18 to 21 years of everything from diapers to college tuition?

        Thanks for your note. The fact that Christmas Eve and Christmas fall in December explain the averages you've calculated. Those days cause people to move up some births to days that don't appear in the chart. You want to focus on the difference in births between the last few days of the year and the first few days of the next year. Check out Thursday, Jan. 2, and Friday, Jan. 3, compared with Monday, Dec. 30, and Tuesday, Dec. 31.
