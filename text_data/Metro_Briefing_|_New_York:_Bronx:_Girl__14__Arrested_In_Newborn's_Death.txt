        A 14-year-old girl was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter yesterday, one day after the body of her newborn daughter was found face down in a patch of grass outside her Bronx housing complex, the police said. The teenager, Letteschia Binns, is accused of throwing the newborn from a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Eastchester Gardens housing complex shortly after giving birth, the police said. The newborn suffered blunt impact injuries to the head and torso, said Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office. Ms. Binns was at Jacobi Medical Center yesterday for undisclosed reasons, according to a hospital spokesman.
