        Re ''Eddie Murphy Inspires Oscar Buzz. Seriously'' by Craig Modderno [Dec. 3]:
        In your article on Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock says, ''Peter Sellers got tons of credit for doing multiple characters, but that was just him doing him.'' Mr. Rock's contention could not be more inaccurate. Sellers relished challenging himself as an actor with characters of wildly varying ages and ethnicities (as has Mr. Murphy), testing how far he could go away from himself and into character. The real Peter Sellers was never a disturbed scientist, an ineffectual president or any of the other roles he played. He is most deserving of what Mr. Rock scornfully refers to as the ''tons of credit.''
