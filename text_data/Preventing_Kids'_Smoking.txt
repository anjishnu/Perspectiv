        To the Editor:
        I take strong issue with your Nov. 27 editorial ''When Don't Smoke Means Do.''
        We understand the skepticism regarding how a tobacco company can be serious about preventing youth from smoking, but our business is grounded in competing for the largest share of the adult tobacco market.
        As a business and as parents, we don't want kids to smoke, and when society feels that we behave otherwise, it actually harms our business.
        Youth smoking prevention is a complex problem whose solution requires a comprehensive approach. Our program is based on positive youth development and is guided by parenting and child development experts on our Parent Advisory Board.
        While we have serious concerns with the design and conclusions of the study cited in your editorial, the study does highlight the need for continued understanding of how parent-directed youth smoking prevention advertising affects youth.
        We intend to pursue this issue and to engage with relevant experts to identify opportunities to improve all youth smoking prevention efforts, especially our own.
