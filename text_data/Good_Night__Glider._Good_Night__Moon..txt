        Nurseryworks, a maker of contemporary children's furnishings, has introduced several pieces of furniture designed by Truck Product Architecture. The Goodnight Glider (above; $1,100 to $1,400), with a bent plywood base and matching ottoman ($620 to $720), is roomy enough for both parent and child. Accompanying it are cribs, including the Loom ($590 to $650), with irregularly spaced slats, and the Studio ($1,780), which features a storage unit with a flip-down changing tray that doubles as a child's desk. Both cribs can be converted to toddler beds. Information: nurseryworks.net; (888) 508-9540.  CURRENTS: NURSERY FURNITURE
