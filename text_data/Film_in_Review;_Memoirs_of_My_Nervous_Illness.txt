        Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Julian P. Hobbs  Not rated; 80 minutes
        Following his Tony Award-winning turn as a German transvestite in ''I Am My Own Wife,'' the American actor Jefferson Mays is back in rouge and petticoats for ''Memoirs of My Nervous Illness,'' a punctilious account of madness and womb envy.
        Based on the journal of the German judge Daniel Paul Schreber (Mr. Mays) during his turn-of-the-century stay in a Leipzig sanatorium, the movie documents his clamorous decline in scenes of disturbing potency. Claiming to converse with God by means of an ecstatic ''nerve language,'' Schreber is prescribed opium and tepid baths by the asylum's egotistical shrink, Dr. Emil Flechsig (Robert Cucuzza). These ministrations do nothing to discourage the patient's feminine side, and soon he's turning a straitjacket into a makeshift corset and a bedsheet into a strapless gown. The result is an ensemble few debutantes could pull off, but Mr. Mays looks absolutely fabulous.
        Bracketed by a strong courtroom scene of Schreber arguing eloquently for his release, ''Memoirs of My Nervous Illness'' is an account of a bizarre case that contributed to the theories of, among others, Freud and Lacan. Julian P. Hobbs directs by getting out of the way of his star's soulful eyes and considerable talent, allowing Mr. Mays to feed on the tension between the rationality of his character's courtroom argument and the utter lunacy of his beliefs. ''I communicate with souls,'' Schreber says, a line that says as much about Mr. Mays's performance as his character's grand delusion.
