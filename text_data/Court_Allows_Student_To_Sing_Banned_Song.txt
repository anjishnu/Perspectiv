        The next time Olivia Turton's school holds its ''Frenchtown Idol'' talent show, she will be able to sing ''Awesome God,'' a song the school district once prohibited.
        Judge Freda L. Wolfson of Federal District Court ruled on Monday that because the talent show was not in the curriculum, was open to the whole community and attendance was not required, the song was not a case of the school conveying a religious message.
        Olivia, who is now 9 and in fourth grade, wanted to sing the song at the show in May 2005. School officials said it would be considered proselytizing, so she was not allowed to.
        Her parents, Maryann and Robert Turton, sued the district and were represented by Demetrios K. Stratis, a lawyer from Wayne, who was working for the Alliance Defense Fund, a group based in Arizona that says it promotes the spread of the Gospel and the sanctity of human life. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the Turton family.
        ''We are ecstatic,'' Mr. Stratis said after the ruling. ''The judge came up with the right decision.'' The suggestion that Olivia ''could be proselytizing was ridiculous,'' he said. ''It was violating her constitutional rights.''
        The Frenchtown administration was willing to let Olivia sing another religious song at the show, at Edith Ort Thomas Elementary School, but said it thought the song she chose had violent language and was proselytizing. Lyrics, by Rich Mullins, include: ''It wasn't for no reason/That he shed his blood/His return is very close/And so you better be believing that/Our God is an awesome God.''
