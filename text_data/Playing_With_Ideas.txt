        Kudos to Daphne Merkin for her intelligent essay on Tom Stoppard (Nov. 26). Her task, made more difficult by an elusive Stoppard, was enriched by her self-reflection and her remarkable insight into Stoppard's endeavors to keep a veil between himself and the probing of an inquisitive public. Her portrait gave us a true picture of this brilliant, very private man.

        A well-recognized trait of women is a need to know as much as possible about a man with whom they have a relationship; Merkin's article demonstrates the pique when the male resists. Her article was subverted by recurrent unflattering references to Stoppard's attitudes and various preferences. Furthermore, although she acknowledges that he has been labeled ''conservative,'' she failed to detail not only why but also how his positions have, at times, made him a pariah among the left in London; witness the hue and cry when he made remarks considered inimical to some modern artists and their works several years ago. She might have fixed on one of the major themes of ''The Coast of Utopia,'' which suggests that the concept of collectivism that mesmerized the intellectual European community during the 19th century probably led to a number of the horrors of the 20th century.
