        WHAT WAS IT? 1981 Cadillacs with the V8-6-4 engine, including the Eldorado, the deVilles, the Seville and the Fleetwood.
        AND THE POINT WAS? After OPEC turned off the oil spigot in 1973 and gasoline conservation became a priority, the federal government established corporate average fuel economy standards, thereafter known as CAFE. Stuck with big, inefficient cars, General Motors' Cadillac division came up with a V-8 engine that would shut down either two or four cylinders when they weren't needed, improving fuel economy.
        A REALITY CHECK:  While the concept behind the V8-6-4 was sound -- G.M. and DaimlerChrysler are using conceptually similar technology in some engines today -- the 1981 onboard computer that deactivated the cylinders was so slow the engine often stumbled and hesitated.
        THE ADS SAID: ''More going for it than the luxury imports. More advanced technology like V8-6-4. No luxury import offers an engine that goes from 8 to 6 to 4 cylinders.'' No, the imports saw smaller, efficient, multivalve engines as a fuel-economy solution.
        THE CRITICS SAID: Popular Hot Rodding magazine listed the V8-6-4 as one of the worst automobile engines ever.
        WHAT'S IT WORTH? Dealers deactivated the cylinder system by the thousands. Yet collectors don't seem bothered by '81 Cadillacs, since the basic, underlying engine (a 368 cubic-inch V-8) wasn't so bad. In 2002, an '81 Eldorado with low miles sold at an auction in Las Vegas for a surprisingly high $8,640.
