        The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the renomination of Associate Justice Jaynee LaVecchia of the New Jersey Supreme Court after questioning her about the court's recent decisions, including its Oct. 25 ruling on gay marriage. Justice LaVecchia, 52, was appointed by Gov. Christie Whitman. In New Jersey, judges must be renominated and reconfirmed for tenure after serving seven years. Only one committee member opposed the nomination. The renomination is expected to be approved by the full Senate.
