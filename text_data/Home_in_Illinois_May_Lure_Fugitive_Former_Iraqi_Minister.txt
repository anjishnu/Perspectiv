        It was an unremarkable scene on Wednesday outside a gated community here where the former Iraqi electricity minister, Aiham Alsammarae, now a fugitive from justice, keeps a palatial house.
        Having escaped from a Baghdad jail over the weekend in what he boasted was the ''Chicago way,'' Mr. Alsammarae, whose whereabouts are unknown, could have been on the way back here.
        Or perhaps he had already arrived, enjoying the serenity of the leafy surroundings of the Covington subdivision, about a half-hour west of Chicago.
        Dennis Brugh, the property manager of the subdivision, where homes range in price from $1.5 million to $4 million, said that whatever trouble Mr. Alsammarae had found in Iraq, here ''he was a homeowner in good standing.''
        ''He kept his house just like any other guy,'' said Mr. Brugh, who works for Oak and Dale Properties, a management company. ''He'd have to or else we'd be all over it.''
        Mr. Alsammarae, who holds dual American and Iraqi citizenship, moved to the Chicago area in the late 1970s but returned to Iraq just after the American-led invasion.
        He was jailed four months ago on corruption charges related to deals made when he was the electricity manager, from August 2003 to May 2005.
        In a phone conversation with a reporter on Tuesday, Mr. Alsammarae said he escaped over the weekend and fled Iraq on a flight from Baghdad International Airport. Officials in Iraq acknowledged the escape but doubted some of the details he offered.
        The watchman at the Covington entrance, who either stops or waves through every car that approaches, said Wednesday that he knew Mr. Alsammarae but that he had not seen him ''in quite some time.''
        Was that days or months?
        The watchman, who would not give his name, would not elaborate.
