        To the Editor:
        I was sickened and saddened as I read ''At Holiday Parties, St. Nick Starts to Morph Into Bacchus'' (Dec. 10). Five hundred votive candles indeed. That's about 2,500 short of the American death toll in Iraq. And $500 a person for vodka and caviar service while mothers and children starve in Darfur. Party burnout as Iraq burns. God save us.
