        A DNA match led to the conviction on Monday of a man who raped a woman in front of her 8-month-old granddaughter in 1998, prosecutors said yesterday. The defendant, Jamel Ash, 29, was convicted of first-degree rape in State Supreme Court, said Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney. Mr. Ash was charged after the police matched a sample from the crime to DNA he had given after a burglary conviction, Mr. Hynes said. Mr. Ash was convicted of breaking into a 53-year-old woman's home on Thanksgiving night in 1998, stealing her jewelry and raping her.
