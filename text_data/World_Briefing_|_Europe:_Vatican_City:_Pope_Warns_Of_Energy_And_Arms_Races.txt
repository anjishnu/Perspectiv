        Pope Benedict XVI challenged the world to find greater peace through a deeper respect for human rights, as he lamented terrorism, civilian deaths in the war in Lebanon and the spread of nuclear weapons. In his annual message for peace, Benedict worried about ''the race for energy sources'' and well as a ''fear of a possible atomic catastrophe.'' He also urged a greater respect for humanitarian law, saying that in Lebanon, the duty to protect, help and avoid involving the civilian population ''was largely ignored.'' He mentioned neither Hezbollah nor Israel by name. Even faced with what he called the ''scourge of terrorism,'' states should not react with unrestrained force if doing so would endanger civilians, he wrote, and called for ''reflection on the ethical limits restricting the use of modern methods of guaranteeing internal security.''
