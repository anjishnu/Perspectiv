        NORMAND--William Clay, M.D., age 84, on December 11, 2006. Bill died peacefully, surrounded by family, with dignity and humor, lucid and brave, reciting poetry until the end (''even the weariest river''). Born August 3, 1922 in Kansas City, MO; grew up a Trillin-style Midwestern Jew, accelerated graduation from Harvard College 43 to enlist in U.S. Army signals intelligence; medical degree from University of Kansas; trained psychiatrist - psychoanalyst; founded at Metropolitan Hospital one of the nation's first walk-in outpatient clinics providing quality care to low income mentally ill; over 40 years private practice in NYC; adjunct professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine; president of the Society of Medical Psychoanalysts; widely published in psychiatric journals. A respected husband, father, friend, colleague, and teacher, Bill was loved by many, hated by none. He practiced morality but never preached it. He will be remembered as the kindest man ever to stroll the streets of New York. He is survived by wife Marjorie, children Andrew, Roger and Jocelyn, daughter-in-law Sarah, and grandchildren Zayd, Samar and Lyla. Memorial celebration this Sunday, December 17, 2006, 3-6 pm at Harvard Club, 27 West 44th.
