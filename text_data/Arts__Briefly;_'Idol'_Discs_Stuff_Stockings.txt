        Last week holiday shoppers loaded up on recent hit albums -- especially those by ''American Idol'' alumni -- but the biggest sellers were two new CDs: ''The Inspiration'' (Def Jam), the second album by the Atlanta rapper Young Jeezy, and the ''Idol'' winner Taylor Hicks's self-titled disc. ''The Inspiration'' reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart with 352,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and Mr. Hicks's album, on Arista, is at No. 2 with 298,000 sales. Mary J. Blige's new ''Reflections (A Retrospective)'' (Geffen) reached No. 9, but the rest of the Top 10 is repeats, with each album enjoying significant sales gains over the previous week: the ''Hannah Montana'' soundtrack (No. 3), ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' Vol. 23 (No. 4), Josh Groban (No. 5), the ''American Idol'' stars Carrie Underwood (No. 6) and Chris Daughtry (No. 7), the Beatles' ''Love'' (Capitol, No. 8), and Il Divo (No. 10).
