        When Hewlett-Packard announced the impending retirement of its long-serving finance chief, Robert P. Wayman, it did not mention how much it would pay him after he left.
        Not that he will have to worry about cash as he plays golf near his home in Hawaii, travels and serves on corporate boards. He sold shares worth $29.1 million in the last 18 months and H.P. tipped him $3 million for serving as interim C.E.O. for 52 days, after the board fired Carleton S. Fiorina.
        That works out to $57,692 a day.
        Ms. Fiorina archly (and inaccurately) noted the largess in her memoir, ''Tough Choices,'' but she did not mention her own severance package. It was at least $21.4 million, though two shareholders lawsuits say it could be much more, depending on how her stock grants are valued.
        At Mr. Wayman's day rate, that works out to slightly more than a year's pay for not coming back to work.
