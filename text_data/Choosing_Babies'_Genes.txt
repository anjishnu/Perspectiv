        Re ''Wanting Babies Like Themselves, Some Parents Choose Genetic Defects'' (Essay, Dec. 5): Although a physician's primary responsibility is to his or her patient, a physician also has a public duty to society. If the patient's request would possibly be of some real harm to either the baby or to society, it simply should not be honored. Physicians should not be assisting prospective parents in knowingly choosing to bring to term defective children.

        I understand deaf parents wanting a deaf child who can share in their culture. But they should understand that deaf culture is shrinking. Hearing aids and cochlear implants provide deaf children with the opportunity to learn to speak and to have access to educational, social and employment opportunities. The few deaf parents who are withholding hearing aids and cochlear implants from their deaf children are severely restricting their children's life choices.
