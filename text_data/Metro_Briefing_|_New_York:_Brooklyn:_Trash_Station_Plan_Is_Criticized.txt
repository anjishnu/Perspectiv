        A plan by the City Sanitation Department to build a trash-transfer station at the site of a former incinerator on the Bensonhurst waterfront was denounced yesterday by Assemblyman William Colton, the chairman of the State Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management. At a news conference, Mr. Colton presented an analysis of nine sediment samples from Gravesend Bay made by Peddrick Weis, a professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The analysis found elevated levels of toxic metals and other harmful materials. The new facility would require repeated dredging of the bay, which Mr. Colton said would stir up toxins and harm birds and aquatic creatures. Vito A. Turso, a Sanitation Department spokesman, said he had not seen the analysis, but said the department's plan would meet environmental and community concerns.
