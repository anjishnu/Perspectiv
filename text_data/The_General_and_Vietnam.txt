        Re ''Name That Source,'' by Murray Fromson (Op-Ed, Dec. 11):
        Having served as a first lieutenant in Vietnam some two years after Gen. Frederick Weyand's confidential assessment that ''the war is unwinnable,'' I would have preferred his going public with his views rather than sparing the feelings of his commanders and not sparing the lives of his subordinates.
        Generals then, as now, seem to be candid only when they retire. Which part of Duty, Honor, Country is this?
