        The Los Angeles Dodgers will not file a tampering charge against the Red Sox over Boston's signing of J. D. Drew, the Dodgers said yesterday.
        ''We have decided that we are not going to pursue it anymore,'' Josh Rawitch, a club spokesman, said by telephone from Los Angeles, speaking for General Manager Ned Colletti.
        The decision ends the issue because the commissioner's office does not plan to pursue it. ''We have no information so we would have no reason to look into it,'' said Jimmie Lee Solomon, executive vice president for baseball operations.
        Under terms of his five-year contract with the Dodgers, Drew opted out of the final three years Nov. 10, forfeiting $33 million. His agent, Scott Boras, announced on Dec. 5 that Drew had signed a five-year, $70 million contract with the Red Sox.
        The decision by Drew, an often-injured outfielder, to walk away from the Dodgers' contract stirred suspicion about tampering among executives of other teams. Some executives said the issue was a hot topic of conversation at the general managers' meetings last month and at the winter meetings last week.
