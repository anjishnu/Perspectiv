        rma virumque cano. ''Arms and the man I sing,'' Virgil announces at the opening of the ''Aeneid.'' And in this issue, the Book Review also sings of arms and the man. War, in all its varieties and aspects, is the topic: from the cover review of Robert Fagles's new translation of Virgil's epic (where the beginning phrase is rendered ''Wars and a man I sing'') through seven other reviews and a roundup, and finally to a back-page symposium in which 11 experts recommend noteworthy books on the subject. Their responses include names that belong on anyone's shortlist -- Thucydides, Clausewitz -- along with titles from less well-known authors and some surprises (''Gone With the Wind''). The books under review are no less varied. War is almost as capacious a subject as love, and among the themes discussed in this issue are technology, genocide, civil liberties, America's westward expansion and dating habits in Baghdad's Green Zone. These days, it seems, authors and publishers are devoting renewed attention to this most traditional of subjects -- for obvious reasons. Not only are we embroiled in a divisive war, but in the age of terror, as one of our reviewers points out, no one is quite sure what the meaning of ''war'' is anymore.
