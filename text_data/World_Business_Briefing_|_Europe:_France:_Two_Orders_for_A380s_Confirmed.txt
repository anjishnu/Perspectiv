        Singapore Airlines and Qantas of Australia have confirmed orders for a total of 17 A380 jets from Airbus, giving the European plane maker its first firm sales of the superjumbo jet in more than a year. The nine-plane deal for Singapore, initially announced in July, nearly doubles its initial purchase of 10 planes. Qantas, which already had 12 of the jets on order, confirmed a commitment for 8 more, Bloomberg News reported. The moves dispel months of speculation that the carriers might cancel orders as a result of manufacturing delays that have pushed back A380 deliveries.
