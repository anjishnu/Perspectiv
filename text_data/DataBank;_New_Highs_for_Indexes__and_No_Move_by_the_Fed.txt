        It was another outstanding week for the stock market, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Friday both reaching all-time closing highs.
        The Nasdaq composite index's close on Friday was the highest since 2001.
        Federal Reserve policy makers on Tuesday left the benchmark short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, saying that while weakness in housing had slowed the growth of the economy, inflation remained a concern. That sent the market down slightly that day, but stocks rebounded smartly.
        General Electric shares gained 5.9 percent for the week, the best performance in the Dow. The company's chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, forecast strong earnings growth next year on expansion in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
        For the week, the Dow gained 138.03 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 12,445.52. The S.& P. 500 rose 17.25 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,427.09. The Nasdaq climbed 19.84 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,457.20.
        The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond increased to 4.59 percent, from 4.55 percent the previous week.

        Correction:  December 20, 2006, Wednesday  An article in Business Day on Saturday about the latest report on consumer prices, which showed that inflation was being held in check, referred incorrectly to Friday's close of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. (The error was repeated in the DataBank on Sunday.) The close of 1,427 was a six-year high, not the record high. (The record was 1,527 in March 2000.)
