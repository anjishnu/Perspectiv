        Douglas Carter Beane will be coming back to Broadway for the second time this season, after making his debut this fall with his play ''The Little Dog Laughed.'' The producers Robert Ahrens and Dan Vickery have announced that Mr. Beane's take on the cult 1980 movie-musical ''Xanadu'' will be skating into the Helen Hayes Theater in May. ''Xanadu,'' for those who don't remember or chose to forget, starred Olivia Newton-John as a heaven-sent muse who inspires the creation of an enormous disco roller rink. The musical, directed by Christopher Ashley (''All Shook Up''), will include songs from the movie's soundtrack, produced by Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra and John Farrar, among them the hit ''Magic.'' Casting has not been announced, though Jane Krakowski and Cheyenne Jackson played the leading roles in a workshop last summer.
