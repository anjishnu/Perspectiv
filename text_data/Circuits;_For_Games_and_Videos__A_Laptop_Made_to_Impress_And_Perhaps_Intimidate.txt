        Fans of high-definition video have a friend in the Dell XPS M1710, a monster laptop that in its most expensive configuration can read and write the new Blu-Ray high-definition discs. But does that warrant its $3,699 price tag?
        Well, there are other high-end features in the package, including a 17-inch screen, a 2.4-gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo T7600 processor and an Nvidia GeForce Go 7950 GTX graphics chip. A full gigabyte of memory and 80 gigabytes of hard drive space are also inside.
        The laptop has an ExpressCard slot and six U.S.B. ports. A D.V.I.-out port lets you connect this beast to an HD television.
        All of that means the M1710 is almost perfectly suited to play the latest games and to play and record HD video in its full glory.
        Aimed at the die-hard gamer and media fanatic, the M1710 is obviously not for everyone. At nine pounds, this laptop is less portable than luggable, but its high-style features -- particularly the colored lights on the brushed-metal case, which comes in red or black -- will make quite an impression at the cybercafe.
