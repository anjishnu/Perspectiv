        Re ''Now This Albany Home Awaits Spitzer's Touch'' (news article, Dec. 12):
        To sum up the neighborhood surrounding the governor's mansion in Albany as ''far from perfect'' is to overlook one of the state capital's most vibrant neighborhoods.
        Depressed by the isolation of living among the manicured lawns of one of Boston's exorbitantly expensive suburbs, my partner and I made a list of criteria for our ideal place to live. We city-shopped for several years before discovering Albany's Mansion neighborhood, where we bought a home three years ago.
        Perfect? No. But the neighborhood we call home -- the close-knit community of friendly people, the blocks lined with flowers in the summertime, an easy walk to cafes and bookstores, and the racial and class diversity -- was exactly what we were looking for.
        We look forward to welcoming our new governor to the neighborhood.
