        To the Editor:
        ''The Dextrous Dictator'' (editorial, Dec. 11) is a shrewd analysis of Augusto Pinochet's methods but doesn't mention a crucial aspect of opposition to his rule in Chile.
        From the earliest days, he faced a brave and nonviolent movement for human rights led by the Catholic Church that he could not repress.
        This moral resistance grew over the years and eventually catalyzed the democratic opposition and the return to elected government.
        Reaching across the deep enmities between parties, it had no precedent in Chile's history and represents a fundamental ethical legacy for its democracy.
