        The holidays may be the season of giving, but Lockheed Martin has decided that it's also a good time to take certain things away. Sort of.
        In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company, the world's biggest military contractor, said it would no longer pay its executives' annual fees at country or social clubs after Jan. 1. Nor will it pay for cars and drivers for personal use, tickets to sporting events and concerts, or financial advice and tax preparation.
        Executives hired after Jan. 1 will not be eligible for the ''postretirement'' death benefits promised to their predecessors, nor will they be reimbursed for initiation fees at country clubs.
        Don't worry. Lockheed Martin is not just putting coal in executives' stockings. In the filing, it said it would give raises to make up for the lost perks. The chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, will receive an extra $40,000, for example, while Robert B. Coutts, an executive vice president, will get $25,000.
