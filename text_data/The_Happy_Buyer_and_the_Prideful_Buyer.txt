        People are more receptive to happy advertising when they have just made an impulse purchase at a moderate discount, according to a paper in the December issue of the Journal of Consumer Research. When they resist that purchase, they are impervious to happy ads, but receptive to ads appealing to their pride.
        The researchers put Columbia students through ostensibly unrelated studies. The students read about a moderately discounted purchase and decided whether they would make it. Those who made the purchase tended to feel happier, and those who resisted it were proud of their restraint. In the next study, they faced an ad headlined either ''The Pride of a Columbia Lion'' or ''Happy to Be at Columbia!'' with copy to match.
        Gita Johar, a professor at Columbia and one of the paper's two authors, said the research could be useful to online retailers. When someone impulsively buys a book based on Amazon's recommendation, for example, the site could modify its ads accordingly.
