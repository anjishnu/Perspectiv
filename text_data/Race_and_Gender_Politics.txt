        Re ''The Pattern May Change, If '' (Week in Review, Dec. 10):
        It is a sad, sad commentary on the state of America when, at the close of 2006, we are allowing issues of race and gender determine who is best to lead us.
        Much of the rest of the civilized world -- Britain, Germany and Chile, to name just a few -- have put biases behind them and elected the best leader for the job, even when the best leader just happened to be female.
        All across the world, discrimination is falling, while here in our own country, all the glass ceilings are still held up by outdated prejudices.
        The United States cannot hope to be a symbol of freedom and equality abroad until it also learns to embrace those ideals here at home.
