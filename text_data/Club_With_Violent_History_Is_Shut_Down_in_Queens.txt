        It was in the early-morning darkness that the bullets came for Ernesto Salgado. He was in his car, parked alongside a raucous Queens strip club where men peddled cocaine and women traded carnal charms for cash.
        The place, Club Phenomenon on 30th Avenue in Woodside, had long been a neighborhood scourge, known for violence, gunplay and prostitution. And on Oct. 1, Mr. Salgado, 22, became the third person in three years to be fatally shot outside its doors.
        Yesterday, the forbidding, windowless club was padlocked after a five-month investigation by the Queens district attorney's office and the police vice squad. Mr. Salgado's mother, Michelle Nova, had also been pressing for the club's closing, with the support of a Queens city councilman, Eric N. Gioia, who said the nine-year-old club should not have been allowed to stay open for so long.
        ''This place is a death trap,'' said Mr. Gioia, who organized a protest to urge the State Liquor Authority to pull the club's license. ''I'm happy we've closed this place. But I want to know how many establishments are potentially dangerous, or remained open with standing violations and a history of violence.''
        The shuttering of Club Phenomenon came nearly three weeks after the death of Sean Bell, an unarmed man shot by the police on his wedding day. Mr. Bell, 23, had also just left another bar in Queens, Club Kalua, which was allowed to remain open despite being repeatedly cited -- and temporarily shuttered -- for prostitution and drug sales. The Queens district attorney's office would not say whether the shooting of Mr. Bell, which the office is investigating, gave renewed urgency to efforts to close Club Phenomenon.
        But the closing followed a number of violations. Undercover officers were solicited by prostitutes and sold drugs, according to District Attorney Richard A. Brown. Nearly three dozen arrests were made at Club Phenomenon over the last year, on charges including prostitution, drug sales and gun possession.
        Eight shootings have occurred either in or around the club, according to a spokesman for Mr. Brown. One resulted in the death of Mr. Salgado. In November 2003, David Garcia, 23, was fatally shot during a fight. No arrests have been made in either shooting. In May 2004, Francisco Rosa, 32, a bouncer, died in a shooting that also wounded two other bouncers. A Brooklyn man has been charged with second-degree murder, and awaits trial.
        Telephone calls to Dimitrios Mitsios, who is listed on the liquor license as the club's owner, and Melvin Cohen, his landlord, were not returned. A hearing on the closing is scheduled for next week. But according to Mr. Brown's office, the landlord is already in eviction hearings. The State Liquor Authority had cited Club Phenomenon nearly two dozen times from 2003 to 2005, for infractions like noise complaints, disorderly conduct and failure to comply with health regulations.
        This year, the club paid $15,000 in fines. Still, it was allowed to stay open.
        William Crowley, a spokesman for the Liquor Authority, said his agency was not allowed to pull the club's liquor license based on the past violations because the fines had been paid. And to revoke the license because of the fatal shootings, the agency would have had to show that the club allowed the shootings to occur, Mr. Crowley said.
        But all of the fatal shootings occurred outside the club. Still, Mr. Gioia is pushing for the Liquor Authority to post violations by various establishments online, so would-be patrons could discover potential problems or hazards.
        Ms. Nova learned of the other shooting deaths near the club only after visiting her son's grave in Queens. There, she happened to meet the mother of Mr. Garcia, Lilly Guillen, who had buried her son in the same cemetery. ''I learned it was not the first killing,'' Ms. Nova said. ''How many more killings do we need in order to shut it down?''
        Neighbors were relieved to hear of the closing, saying that they avoided the area. ''It's not just the violence,'' said Martha Vega, who lives two blocks from the club. ''It's the music, the fighting and the screaming.''
