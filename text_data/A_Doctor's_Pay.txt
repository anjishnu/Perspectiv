        Re ''Medicare, in a Different Tack, Moves to Link Doctors' Payments to Performance'' (news article, Dec. 12): Representative Pete Stark of California is correct when he says, ''The entire concept of pay-for-performance is offensive.'' The idea that I will work smarter for a few pennies more demeans me as a person and as a professional.
        If federal ''medicrats'' are so concerned about quality of care, let them concentrate their lumbering methods on stiffening the standards for medical school admission, national testing, licensure and recertification.
        They would have to work hand in hand with state agencies in these efforts, but it sure beats trying to bribe me with what amounts to a baloney sandwich.
