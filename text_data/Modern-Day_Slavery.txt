        To the Editor:
        ''A Cambodian Girl's Tragedy: Being Young and Pretty,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Dec. 12), is right to distinguish between sex work by choice and the very different ''enslavement of people'' that is coercion and human trafficking.
        But he wrongly praises President Bush's policy in this area as one of his few diplomatic successes. The Bush administration ignores the differences, treating sex workers as though all were coerced, and dealing with all human trafficking as if it were exclusively for sexual purposes.
        Such an approach can only fail in every way: it will not halt human trafficking, which is in fact chiefly for other kinds of labor, and it will do nothing to improve the lives of the millions of sex workers who now struggle against discrimination and violence that go unpunished.
