        A front-page article yesterday about the Taliban's growing strength in northern Pakistan omitted a credit. David Rohde contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan. The credits for two photographs that accompanied the continuation of the article were reversed. The photograph of a bombing in a Peshawar market was by Mohammad Zubair of The Associated Press; the photograph showing an embrace between the Taliban commander Mullah Dadulla and a would-be suicide bomber was by Reuters Video News.
