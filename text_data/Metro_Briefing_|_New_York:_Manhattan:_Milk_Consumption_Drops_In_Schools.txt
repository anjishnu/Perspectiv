        Milk consumption by city schoolchildren has dropped by about 10 percent after officials removed whole milk from cafeteria menus in February as part of an effort to reduce childhood obesity, the City Education Department said yesterday. The city, which serves about a half-million half pints of milk a day, continues to serve 1 percent milk and skim milk. The city released the information in advance of a City Council hearing on the subject today.
