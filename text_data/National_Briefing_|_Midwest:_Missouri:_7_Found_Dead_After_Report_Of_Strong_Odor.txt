        Seven people, including two young children, were found dead on Sunday in a duplex house in Kirksville, about 200 miles northwest of St. Louis. After an emergency call alerted them to several ''unresponsive'' people inside the house and a strong odor coming from within, paramedics found the bodies of the 23-year-old female tenant, her 23-month-old daughter, her 1-year-old son and a woman and three men ranging in age from 19 to 21, Chief James C. Hughes of the Kirksville Police Department said. A sensor reading taken by a firefighter showed ''a high concentration of a substance that is potentially harmful,'' Chief Hughes said. Local news reports identified the substance as carbon monoxide, but Chief Hughes declined to confirm those reports.
