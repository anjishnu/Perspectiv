        The incoming Democratic chairmen of Congress's appropriations committees announced last week that a big chunk of the federal government will operate next year under 2006 budgets. That will allow the new Congress to focus on programs where needs are great -- and rising -- like veterans' health care and low-income housing. It will also free up time to pursue a fresh legislative agenda.
        Under normal circumstances, operating under old budgets would be a dereliction of lawmakers' duty to weigh needs and resources, and spend tax dollars accordingly. But the current situation is hardly normal. The departing Republican-led Congress was supposed to nail down the government's spending plans for 2007 before it adjourned, but it neglected to do so, passing only 2 of the 11 required appropriations bills.
        The delay was initially due to infighting among Republicans, sparked by President Bush, who gunned for a spending limit that was so low that many Republicans were unwilling to support it openly. The delay dragged on as Republican leaders refused to hold difficult votes before the midterm elections. Then, during the lame duck session, they did not even try to complete the spending bills -- a crass attempt to force the new Democratic majority to expend time and energy cleaning up the mess.
        By choosing to operate much of next year's government at the 2006 level, the Democrats avoid that trap. But solving the political problem creates some practical ones. President Bush, for example, will have to step up during the year to ask for more money as needed.
        But Mr. Bush is to blame for this problem in the first place. Next year he will have the chance to make amends, if only he will take it.
