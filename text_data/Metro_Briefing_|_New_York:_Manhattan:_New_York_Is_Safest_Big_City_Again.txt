        New York City remained the safest big city in the nation in the first half of 2006, according to city officials who cited an F.B.I. report released yesterday. The report showed a 7.2 percent drop in overall crime compared with the same period a year earlier. In a statement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the results, but added, ''There's more to do, which is why I've made stopping the illegal flow of guns into our city a top priority.'' Police statistics show that from Jan. 1 through Dec. 10, the number of homicides increased to 551 from 505, a 9.1 percent increase over the same period in 2005, though this year's tally includes a high number of deaths of crime victims who sustained their injuries long ago. This year's count includes 33 such deaths, compared with 18 in 2005.
