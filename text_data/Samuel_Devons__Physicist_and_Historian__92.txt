        Samuel Devons, a physicist and historian of science at Columbia University who combined research in nuclear physics with a career-long effort to make science accessible to general audiences, died on Dec. 6 in Manhattan. He was 92 and lived in Irvington, N.Y.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        In the 1960s, while he was chairman of Columbia's physics department, Dr. Devons and others conducted experiments that shed light on the nature of the atom's nucleus.
        As a historian of science, Dr. Devons wrote and spoke about the experiments of Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin and Sir J. J. Thomson, who won a Nobel Prize in physics in 1906 and was one of Dr. Devons's teachers at Cambridge University.
        Samuel Devons was born in Wales. He received an undergraduate degree and doctorate from Trinity College, Cambridge. After working on radar and defense projects for the British government, he taught physics at the Imperial College of the University of London.
        From 1955 to 1960, Dr. Devons was a professor of physics at the University of Manchester. He then moved to Columbia, where he served as chairman of the physics department from 1963 to 1967. He retired in 1984.
        Dr. Devons, who remained a British citizen, is survived by his wife of 68 years, the former Celia Ruth Toubkin; four daughters, Amanda, of Eureka, Calif.; Cathryn, of Ardsley, N.Y.; Judith, of Leicester, England; and Susan Gil of London; a sister, Nina, of Jerusalem; 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
