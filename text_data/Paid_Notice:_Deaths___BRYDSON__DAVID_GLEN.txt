        BRYDSON--David Glen, 74, of New York, NY, died peacefully at home on December 11, 2006 after a valiant battle with cancer. While his body is lost, his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of his close knit family. David was born on December 2, 1932, in Toronto, Canada, the firstborn son of the late Dalton R. and Charlotte (Dale) Brydson. David worked hard and enjoyed 50 successful years in the advertising and media sales industry, beginning the long span in the classified department of Toronto's Globe & Mail in 1957. David later branched out on his own, founding Brydson Global Media Sales in 1980 where his clients knew him for his keen negotiating skills and elegant rapport. The business flourished and went on to 26 years of success. David is survived by his wife of 32 years, Beatrice (Horvath) Brydson, his four children, son Scott of Sherman, CT, son Todd and his wife Rachael of Cape Elizabeth, ME, daughter Nicole and son Michael, both of Brooklyn, NY, two grandchildren, Eva and Jacob of Cape Elizabeth, ME. He is predeceased by his brother Dale and his uncles Gordon and Glen Brydson, prominent athletes in the NHL and Canadian PGA through the 1950s. Also an athletic man, David enjoyed weekends and summers on the beach in East Hampton, N.Y. for over thirty years, and over thirty-five spent as a member of the New York Athletic Club. David was unforgettable. A loving man, with strong character and convictions, he will be forever remembered as a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather. A memorial service will be held at 11 am on December 15, 2006 at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, 7 West 55th St, New York, NY 10019. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to National Public Radio.
