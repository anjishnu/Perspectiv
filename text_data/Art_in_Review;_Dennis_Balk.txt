        Abstract Expressionism meets graffiti photography. Cy Twombly in cyberspace. Existential physics. The trajectories of car bombs. These phrases came to mind at the show of Dennis Balk's new work, made during the last three years while he lived in Bahrain and traveled primarily in the Middle East.
        The show is dominated by black-on-white gestural drawings on canvas from Mr. Balk's Faith Thumbnail series. Full of graphic and even painterly nuance, they turn out to have been made completely on the computer. In a smaller room, the Exhausted and Ideographic series features gaudy, vertiginous digital mixes of colorful photographs. More intermittent and contrasting with the general disorientation are a handful of large, calm portrait-snapshots of Arab men taken at Wehdat, a Palestinian camp in Jordan.
        What all this means is unclear, partly because it looks stylistically familiar, but Mr. Balk has always had a certain interest in recycling. Originally a performance artist, he became known in the art world in the early 1990s for improvisational diagrams that brought different historical narratives into collision. One work in his solo debut at American Fine Arts in SoHo in 1992 charted the lives of Ho Chi Minh and Abraham Lincoln -- both fathers of their countries in different ways -- across white paper napkins. His 2003 exhibition at that gallery was titled ''Particles + Waves With Plausibility,'' as is a recent book of his work. The words evoke arcane science, but also the randomness and inevitability that abound in everyday life, whose combination of chaos and stillness -- experienced at one of history's current hot spots -- Mr. Balk conveys with strange effectiveness.
