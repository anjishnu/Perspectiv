        It may be hard to imagine what the Village People have to do with the Chosen People. Or how the Swedish pop group Abba could facilitate the teaching of Yiddish. But the National Yiddish Theater -- Folksbiene specializes in making connections (between Old World and New, Yiddish and English, and Jews and non-Jews), and does so hilariously in its annual holiday production, ''Kids and Yiddish.'' Conceived by Joanne H. Borts, Menachem (Michael) Fox and Zalmen Mlotek, the show is like a wacky borscht belt-style revue, but much hipper than anything your grandmother might have enjoyed. Written and directed by Ms. Borts, the eighth edition, ''Bagels & Yux!,'' begins with a familiar number, in which Yiddish's distinction as a mama loschen (mother tongue) is explained to the tune of Abba's ''Mamma Mia.'' The cast, consisting of Ms. Borts, Jenny Romaine, Michael Winograd and four delightful children -- Carly Baron, Ava Gantenbein, Aaron Mayer (from left, above) and Lily Shoretz (not pictured) -- gives a nod to Hanukkah in ''Nun, Giml, Hey, Shin.'' The song, about the four Hebrew (and Yiddish) letters on a dreidel, is sung to the tune of the Village People's ''Y.M.C.A.'' New numbers include ''Classic Vov Songs,'' a fake commercial for an album with song titles using the Yiddish letter vov (including ''What's Vov Got to Do With It?'' and ''All You Need Is Vov''). A Broadway-infused highlight is ''Hello, Daled,'' a salute to another letter in which Ms. Borts channels Carol Channing. The 70-minute show also features singalongs, quiz-show moments and ''The Maccabagel Games,'' a kind of Jewish twist on sack races for young audience volunteers. You may not end up learning a lot of Yiddish, but you will have a lot of fun. (Sunday at 10 a.m.; Dec. 23 and Dec. 30 at 11 a.m.; JCC in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, 212-279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $20; $17 for ages 12 and under.)
