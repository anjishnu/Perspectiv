        Re ''Socratic Dialogue Gives Way to PowerPoint'' (Dec. 12): Grand rounds are far more serious now than in the late 1940s when we interns and residents at the old Brigham Hospital used to look forward to sallies between our superiors. Patients disappeared with growing concerns for privacy as they turned into ''cases.'' The focus on disease and physiology rather than illness and narrative played its role, too. Now grand rounds are too often a lecture better read than heard.

        The use of audiovisual equipment has become common in grand rounds. Although some say it is necessary because of the great amount of material to be presented, I disagree. A good teacher in front of a blackboard with lots of enthusiasm should be able to present the most complicated material and keep his or her audience interested. Grand rounds would be improved if teachers worried less about demonstrating their knowledge and more about communicating just what is essential.
