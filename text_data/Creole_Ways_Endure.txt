        Re: '' 'Faerie Folk' Strike Back With Fritters,'' Dec. 6:
        The Creole culture is very much alive and well and is represented in areas across the state of Louisiana as well as across the nation. But it is very rare that identifying oneself as Creole is accepted or understood.
        The main factor for this is a lack of education about the culture and its heritage. Promotion of the history of Creole people is vital to the survival of this important American culture. We are working with Louisiana state offices not only to promote the Creole culture but also to educate the world that it does exist.
