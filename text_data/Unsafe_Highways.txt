        Re ''Making the Highways Less Safe (editorial, Dec. 10):
        As a physician and a scientist studying sleep and neurology, I, too, have been disappointed to see the Bush administration treat safety as a backseat concern when it comes to our nation's highways.
        Knowing that sleep deprivation leads to procedural impairments comparable to alcohol intoxication, relaxing the limits for truckers' hours is tantamount to relaxing the standards for drunken driving.
