        While the small size of a laptop may feel great when you have to haul it through the airport, hunching over that petite PC for hours may lead to neck aches -- or hand cramps from the compact keyboard. While most laptops can be connected to a docking station or bigger monitor, the Logitech Alto portable notebook stand lets you anchor a laptop at eye level and work more comfortably at a table or desk.
        The Alto includes a full-size keyboard with extra programmable keys for things like starting programs or controlling the computer's volume. A U.S.B. port is required to connect the Alto to the laptop, but a small hub built into the stand provides three more U.S.B. 2.0 ports for use in connecting other devices.
        The Alto sells for about $100 and will be available in stores next month; product details are at www.logitech.com. It works with most Windows and Mac OS X laptops weighing less than nine pounds. When not propping up your portable, the Alto folds down to about 9 inches by 17 inches and less than an inch and a half thick. Then, unlike a desktop computer, it can be shoved out of sight.
