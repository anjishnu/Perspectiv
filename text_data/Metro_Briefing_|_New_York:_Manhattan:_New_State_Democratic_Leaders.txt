        New York Democratic officials elected new leaders of the state party at a meeting yesterday. June O'Neill, the Democratic chairwoman in St. Lawrence County, and Dave Pollak, president of a political-advocacy group, DL21C, were elected chairwoman and co-chairman, respectively. Democrats created the two-person structure to represent both upstate and downstate interests.
