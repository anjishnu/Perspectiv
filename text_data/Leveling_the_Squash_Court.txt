        Re ''Out of the Clubhouse and Into the Classroom'' (Everybody's Business, Dec. 10):
        While discussing the growing income disparity among Americans and ways to level the playing field, Ben Stein wonders if the very wealthy ''can be brought off of the fairways of the nation's country clubs and put before the students of America to tell them how the world works and how to make their way in it.''
        While that is possible, another approach may be more likely to succeed: bringing America's less privileged children to the country clubs.
        This process is under way, as sports like golf, sailing, lacrosse and squash have been introduced to a growing number of lower-income communities. While learning these sports, children become exposed to a world defined by opportunities and access.
        In CitySquash, the Bronx after-school program where I work, public school students often stay in the homes of C.E.O.'s and bankers and play squash with their children. The students are learning how the world works and how to make their way in it. It is a start.
