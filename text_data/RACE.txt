        No word on what is being served, but it is the guest list that counts. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is holding a small dinner party Tuesday for Iowans. Most attendees were to have flown to Washington from Iowa -- airfare not included. At least three had conflicts, but former Iowans living in Washington were planning to attend. Among those sending regrets were Bonnie Campbell of Des Moines, a lawyer in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, and a former state Democratic chairman, Gordon Fischer. Aides to the senator asked attendees not to discuss the dinner, just as with another one on Sunday with guests from New Hampshire.
