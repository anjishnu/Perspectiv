        Come December, many sensitive city dwellers turn agoraphobic, what with all those dangerous flu germs and naked Christmas trees hanging out on the street. But thin-skinned, Scrooge-minded theater addicts can still get their fix of greasepaint and misanthropy by hunkering down at home and watching rented vintage movies about backstage backstabbing. And, yes, it is possible to get beyond talking along with the epigrams in ''ALL ABOUT EVE'' (1950), the best movie ever made about Broadway behaving badly.
        Consider, for example, two American films that drench Rialto glitter in the shadows of film noir: ''THE VELVET TOUCH'' (1948) and ''BLACK WIDOW'' (1954), which star, respectively, ROSALIND RUSSELL and GINGER ROGERS as leading ladies whose marquee-diva temperaments just might be lethal. (In ''Black Widow,'' gratifyingly enough, it's the ambitious Eve Harrington type, played by PEGGY ANN GARNER, who finds herself murdered.)
        For those who like to fuel the wintertime blues with a stage star's wallow in the gutter, it would be hard to find better company than the great HELEN MORGAN, an immortal song stylist of the 1920s, rotting and weeping away in increasingly unglamorous burlesque dives in Rouben Mamoulian's fascinating ''APPLAUSE'' (1929), which frames showbiz tawdriness with German Expressionist angles.
        And if you want a little politics thrown into the mix, there is always ''THE ENTERTAINER'' (1960), in which seedy seaside music halls become a prism through which you see the British Empire sinking. What makes Tony Richardson's adaptation of John Osborne's play essential viewing, though, is LAURENCE OLIVIER, in his greatest screen performance, as the dead-eyed vaudevillian Archie Rice. His cynical, sibilant spiels of songs and patter are enough to banish ''Jingle Bells'' from anyone's head.
