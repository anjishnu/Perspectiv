        J. A. Riggs Jr., a former executive vice president at The New York Times who oversaw the newspaper's conversion from hot-lead type to modern offset printing, died Monday in Evanston, Ill. He was 73 and lived in Tucson, Ariz.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Karen Arenson, of Glencoe, Ill.
        Mr. Riggs, who preferred to be called Andy, joined The Times in 1976 as assistant to the general manager. In 1977, he was named director of operations and, in 1979, vice president for operations. In 1988, he was promoted to executive vice president for production.
        The switch to offset printing paved the way for the introduction of color printing in the 1990s, said Tom Lombardo, now The Times's vice president for production, who worked with Mr. Riggs for more than a decade.
        Mr. Riggs also helped plan The Times's highly automated $450 million printing plant in Edison, N.J.
        Joseph Agnew Riggs Jr. was born on Aug. 16, 1933, in Hinsdale, Ill., a son of Joseph and Gretchen Walser Riggs. His father was the president of the Goss Printing Press Company, which in 1960 was bought by the Rockwell International Corporation.
        Besides his daughter, Mr. Riggs is survived by his fourth wife, Laura Schiavone Riggs of Niantic, Conn.; a brother, Henry, of Palo Alto, Calif.; a sister, Ruth Wendel, of Naperville, Ill.; a son, David, of Evanston; and three granddaughters. His previous marriages ended in divorce.
        After graduating from North Carolina State University in 1956, Mr. Riggs became a salesman for Goss Printing, eventually rising to general manager of commercial presses. He retired from The Times in 1989.
        In his 20s, Mr. Riggs learned to fly single-engine Cessnas. In retirement in Tucson, he returned to flying and opened a flight school.
