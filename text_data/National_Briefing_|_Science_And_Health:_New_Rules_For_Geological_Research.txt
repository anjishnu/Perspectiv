        The United States Geological Survey is now requiring its scientists to submit their research papers for internal review before publication, the agency said. In interviews, some agency scientists said the new procedures were routine because reviews of one kind or another had been required for years and had not interfered with the publication of scientific findings. But others in the agency said they feared that the standardized procedures were another effort by the Bush administration to delay or suppress unwelcome scientific information.
