        Members of the New York City teachers' union ratified a new contract that will raise pay by 7.1 percent over two years, the union, the United Federation of Teachers, said yesterday. Ninety percent of the roughly 78,000 votes cast were in favor of the contract, which the union and the Bloomberg administration agreed to last month.
