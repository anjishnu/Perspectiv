        As James Traub's article (Nov. 19) makes clear, the United States should be taking a close look at China's energetic campaign of engagement with Africa, both for what it tells us about Chinese intentions and what it means for our interests.
        The visible signs of Chinese engagement in Africa -- from new soccer stadiums to better roads -- are clear to any traveler to the continent. Unfortunately, in places like Angola, Zimbabwe and Sudan, China has also shown a willingness to support authoritarian or corrupt governments and ignore human rights violations.
        China's willingness to do business with some of Africa's most repressive regimes is not only bad for Africa -- it is also self-defeating. Corrupt African regimes harbor terrorists, mismanage economies and often generate regional instability that isn't in any nation's interest. As we learned during the cold war, American strategic interests in Africa will be advanced by sticking to our principles and by supporting good governance, democratic institutions and human rights. We should treat China's growing engagement in Africa not as a threat but as a reminder of the strategic significance of a part of the world too often ignored. In the vast and diverse continent of Africa, critically important partners, markets, and leaders -- as well as real security threats -- are emerging. The United States should ensure that our efforts and investments pay off for the people of Africa and international security.
