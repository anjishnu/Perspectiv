        The World Bank approved a $180 million no-interest loan to Nigeria for the bank's largest ever malaria-control project. Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, and malaria is the leading cause of illness and death there. The bank, which has come under fire for earlier failings in its malaria programs, has committed $350 million to combating malaria in 10 countries and West Africa over the last 15 months. The money is paying for mosquito nets to prevent malaria and drugs to treat it, among other things.
