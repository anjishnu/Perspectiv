        The New Rochelle City Council, in an effort to strike a compromise in a dispute over open space, last week approved borrowing $500,000 to remove invasive vines from Ward Acres Park, but put off a decision on whether to limit where and when dogs can roam in the park unleashed.
        In passing its 2007 budget on Tuesday, the Council reduced the amount of its original bond offering to $500,000 from $1.2 million, and put off a decision on the most contested element of the bond, establishing a three- to five-acre off-leash dog run in the park.
        For decades, the city has not enforced its leash ordinance in Ward Acres, a 62-acre nature preserve, and the park has become popular with dog owners who come to let their dogs run free.
        At a public forum on Dec. 5, dog walkers advocated maintaining the off-leash status quo, while other residents argued for enforcement of the leash laws. The City Council recommended limiting off-leash hours outside the proposed dog park to before 11 a.m. and from 4 p.m. until dusk on weekdays, and only before 10 a.m. on weekends. ''The hours they are offering are so restrictive and unfair,'' said Vicki Rothweiler, a New Rochelle resident and an advocate for the off-leash dog walkers.
        One issue not in dispute is that vines are destroying large tracts of trees. ''If you don't save the trees, you don't have a park,'' Ms. Rothweiler said.
        Vine removal should begin early next year, Mayor Noam Bramson said, and the City Council will make a decision on the off-leash hours in January.
