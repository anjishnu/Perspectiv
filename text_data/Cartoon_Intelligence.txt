        Re '' 'Star Trek,' the Forgotten Frontier: 1970s Animation'' by Thomas Vinciguerra [Dec. 3]:
        When ''Star Trek: The Animated Series'' was first on, ''Star Trek'' reruns were scattershot and at the mercy of local programmers. For some of us, the animated version was our first and most consistent exposure to the show. Yes, the animation barely deserved the name. (And why was the Enterprise greenish?) But the show's stories assumed that we had brains, a novelty in television to this day.
