        A consortium of five Asian companies and a unit of Verizon Communications has agreed to build a high-speed fiber optic cable to link China and the United States by the time the Olympic Games open in Beijing in August 2008.
        Verizon Business said yesterday that it had signed a construction agreement for the so-called Trans-Pacific Express with China Telecom, China Netcom, China Unicom, Korea Telecom and Chunghwa Telecom of Taiwan. Ownership of the cable will be evenly split among the six participants.
        Today, China and the United States are directly connected by a lone undersea link, built six years ago. The new cable will initially support 1.28 terabits a second of digital data, more than 60 times as much capacity as the existing cable, and will have a design capacity of 5.12 terabits a second, Verizon Business said.
        Construction is to begin by March and end by the third quarter of 2008 at a cost of $500 million, the companies said. The cable will stretch 11,000 miles from Nedonna Beach, Ore., to Qingdao and Chongming in China, and will have landings in Tanshui in Taiwan, and Keoje in South Korea.
        Ihab Tarazi, vice president of Verizon Business's global network planning, said the cable would add capacity to one of the company's highest growth areas and improve data routing speed to China, Hong Kong and India.
        Although it is growing fast, the demand for high-speed access to Asia has not yet outstripped the existing supply, said Stephan Beckert, research director at TeleGeography, a communications research company in Washington. But the new cable will bring competition to the market, which he said was more important than capacity.
        Most of today's trans-Pacific traffic is carried by the VSNL International cable. Two other big systems are being considered by competitors, Mr. Beckert said.
        ''Certainly, China is a big destination, and there is a case to be made for additional routes,'' he said.
