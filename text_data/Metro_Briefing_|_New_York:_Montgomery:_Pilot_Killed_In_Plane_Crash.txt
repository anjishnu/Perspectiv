        The pilot of a small plane was killed when it crashed in a field shortly after taking off from the Orange County Airport yesterday, the police said. The plane, piloted by Frank Holland, 79, of West Orange, N.J., had just left the Montgomery airport about 1 p.m. when it plummeted to the ground, said Lt. Pierce Gallagher of the state police. It was unclear yesterday what caused the plane, a twin-engine Cessna, to go down.
