        Q. If a high-intensity lightning bolt hit someone, would the person's body turn to ash?
        A. There are no medical records of people struck by lightning who were reduced to a pile of ashes, nor of any who burst into flames or were split in half by a lightning bolt, according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
        The only cause of death from lightning is cardiopulmonary arrest. About 70 lightning-related deaths are reported each year.
        Burns are not the big problem with lightning, in medical terms. A lightning strike may flash over the outside of the victim's body, blowing off the clothing, but leave few visible signs of injury and few if any burns.
        The real problem for the estimated one in 10 who survive a lightning strike is a neurological hangover that can be life-changing. Medical information from the National Weather Service says that electrical damage to the brain, autonomic nervous system and peripheral nervous system is common and can leave lasting problems.
        Brain-injured victims have difficulty with things like short-term memory, coding new information and accessing old information; they may be easily distracted and irritable and have permanent personality changes. Fatigue as well as ill-defined and hard-to-treat pain also commonly occur after a lightning injury.

        Q & A
        Correction:  December 16, 2006, Saturday  The Q&A column in Science Times on Tuesday misstated the survival rate for those hit by lightning. It is an estimated 9 in 10 -- not 1 in 10.
