        Michelin, the European map and guide experts, have moved into the new world of G.P.S. The ViaMichelin X-930 is an in-car navigation device with Michelin-approved information about points of interest along the way.
        This device costs about $299 and comes with maps for all 50 states and Canada. It has a 3.5-inch touch screen and weighs 5 ounces, and it includes a mounting kit, cigarette lighter adapter and a memory card for the map information.
        The mapping software offers two- and three-dimensional maps and has a ''bypass'' feature that helps you route around traffic. The ViaMichelin software includes 1.5 million points of interest including gas stations, stores and hotels. The device reads out instructions over the built-in loudspeaker and can also communicate with a PC.
        Already popular in Europe, the X-930 is ViaMichelin's first G.P.S. device to reach the United States. Unfortunately the American model does not include information from the company's guidebooks, like its star ratings of restaurants. But it should be able to point you in the direction of some fast food in a pinch.
