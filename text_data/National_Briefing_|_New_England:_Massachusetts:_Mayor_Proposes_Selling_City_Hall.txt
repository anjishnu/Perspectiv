        Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston is proposing that the bulky concrete City Hall building be sold to a private developer and that government be moved to a new building on the city's waterfront. The City Hall sits on a huge brick plaza known more for its wind gusts than architectural aesthetic, and provides a stark contrast to Boston's brick colonial architecture. Mr. Menino said in a speech that the building was outdated, and along with the plaza, could be worth up to $300 million. A waterfront City Hall, he said, would help shape the waterfront, which is not fully developed.
