        There's no satisfying the desire to get to the head of the pack in the presidential primary sweepstakes. Weary of being a quadrennial wallflower, New Jersey's Legislature moved its primary up from June (long after the nominations are settled) to the last Tuesday in February, right on the heels of the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire's sacrosanct, first-in-the-nation primary.
        But Democratic Party leaders shorted the Garden State spotlight, cramming a Nevada caucus and a South Carolina primary into January. Quick as a proud New Jerseyan says, ''Oh yeah?'' the Legislature is again voting to move the primary up, this time to early February. The state Senate easily approved the date. And the Assembly is waiting to act, with the state expected to join a half-dozen others with a primary on Feb. 5, 2008.
        Our preference has long been for a less frenetic -- dare we say more thoughtful -- system of regional primaries unfolding over several months. Those voters would be a more representative cross section of America than the icy precincts of Iowa and New Hampshire.
        This is the proposal of the association of secretaries of state who run America's elections. It has been long ignored under the show-business urgencies of modern campaigning, with its hokum that Iowa and New Hampshire are sanctuaries for quaint retail politics, rather than overheated Petri dishes for aspirants, spinners and pundits. We again endorse the regional idea -- and yes, we admit it, we're a little bit earlier than usual, too.
