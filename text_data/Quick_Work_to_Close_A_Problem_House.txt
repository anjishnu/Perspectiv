        To the Editor:
        ''The House That Unhinged a Neighborhood'' (Dec. 3) mentioned that the house at 281 Starr Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, had been ''cemented shut'' and ''condemned by the city.'' What you did not mention is how this came to be accomplished in so short a period of time.
        Last month, I was invited to attend a town hall meeting that dealt with the issue of prostitution in the Bushwick-Ridgewood area. After learning of this problem, I immediately directed members of my senior staff to meet with the 83rd Precinct Commander, John Bambury, to strategize. My staff then worked with the Police Department, the Fire Department, the Housing Department and Adult Protective Services to close down 281 Starr Street and to provide necessary services to the elderly resident of this location.
        Although this problem had been a longstanding one for this community, it was only through the swift actions of my staff and the responsiveness of the Police Department that this building could be effectively closed down.
        Although prostitution is far from eliminated in this neighborhood, my office continues to work closely with our partnering agencies in both Brooklyn and Queens on our newly created inter-agency prostitution task force to aggressively address this issue.
