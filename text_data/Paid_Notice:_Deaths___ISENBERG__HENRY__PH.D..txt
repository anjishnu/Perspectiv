        ISENBERG--Henry, Ph.D. Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center mourns the loss of Henry Isenberg, Ph.D, the former chief of microbiology who was a respected and valuable member of the staff. One of the hospital's founding leaders, Dr. Isenberg was instrumental in the growth and development of the medical center and its reputation for excellence in patient care, research and education. He mentored many generations of physicians and nurses, instilling in all of those who he touched the respect for the patient and the science. Dr. Isenberg will be remembered as a scientist, philosopher, patriot and a fascinated observer of human nature. Prior to his retirement in 2005, Dr. Isenberg worked on numerous major research projects and published literally hundreds of articles in a multitude of peer-review journals. He wrote books, edited journals and received nearly every award granted in his field. This man and his amazing spirit will be remembered and missed by all.
