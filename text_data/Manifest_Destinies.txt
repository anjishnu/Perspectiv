        DANGEROUS NATION
        By Robert Kagan.
        527 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
        In his celebrated book ''Of Paradise and Power,'' Robert Kagan took issue with ''the mistaken idea that the American founding generation was utopian, that it genuinely considered power politics 'alien and repulsive' and was simply unable to comprehend the importance of the power factor in foreign relations.'' Those words might stand as one epigraph for his provocative and deeply absorbing new book. Another could be what a South African historian once said about a book of his own: although its pages told of another time, ''they are also about today.''
        From the beginning, Americans liked to believe that they were free of Old-Worldly original sin, dwellers in a city on a hill who ''cherished an image of themselves as by nature inward-looking and aloof.'' And from the beginning, Kagan argues in ''Dangerous Nation,'' they were wrong. In this, the first of two volumes on the United States as an international power, he shows how America was always a player, and often a ruthless one, in the great game of nations.
        Its foreign and domestic politics were continually intertwined, from the first conflict between Jeffersonian Republicans and Hamiltonian Federalists. The great overarching question of slavery also had large international implications. The British campaign against the slave trade enraged Southern slaveholders, while British sympathy for the South in turn enraged the North, as personified by Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. But even his anger was far from disinterested, since he spent most of his career ''eyeing Canada as a great prize to be annexed to the United States as soon as circumstances permitted.'' The American self-image of immaculate conception was indeed absurd in the light of slavery, of expansion across Indian lands and of territorial ambitions.
        And it was far from shared by Europeans, who viewed the infant republic as a threat from its earliest days. When John Quincy Adams was American minister in London in 1817 he reported home (in words that give Kagan his title) the universal European feeling that the United States would become ''a very dangerous member of the society of nations.'' As well as apprehension there was understandable disdain in Europe for American hypocrisy, and here Kagan seems a little perverse.
        He plays a lengthy riff on the term ''liberal,'' as in the ''liberal view,'' or the liberalism that, for ''200 years, was the main engine of American expansion.'' This obviously isn't using the word as Republicans do in denouncing ''liberal Democrats'' (or the way neoconservatives sometimes use it pejoratively), but in the way some historians would say ''bourgeois.'' ''Liberal'' here refers to the modern commercial society that emerged in England and then America in the 18th century, and whose theorists were John Locke and Adam Smith.
        Although Kagan's larger point is valid, it is incongruous to categorize as liberal the early American belief that one day ''the United States would stretch across the entire expanse of the continent,'' or to describe the brutal expropriation of the indigenous inhabitants as ''liberal expansion.'' When some piece of public skulduggery was once described as ''a pious fraud,'' that cynical 18th-century pol Lord Holland replied, ''I can see the fraud, but where is the piety?'' Contemplating the fate of the Cherokees, one can likewise see the expansion more clearly than the liberalism.
        There is no purpose in moralizing too much about distant events. Stuff happens, as we historians say. But then Americans did moralize about their unique destiny, and here Kagan, as an American, does not quite see the ironical twist in the plot. Writing about the centuries-long eastward drive of conquest and extirpation by the Germans, from the Middle Ages onward, A. J. P. Taylor drily observed that if ''the Germans had succeeded in exterminating their Slav neighbors, as the Anglo-Saxons in North America succeeded in exterminating the Indians, the effect would have been what it has been on the Americans: the Germans would have become advocates of brotherly love and international reconciliation.''
        This volume ends with the Spanish-American war of 1898, when it is often held that America lost her virtue and her age of empire began. But, as Kagan shows, there had already been imperial confrontations, with Germany over Samoa and with England over an obscure border dispute in South America in late 1895, which nearly came to war.
        Every chapter of ''Dangerous Nation'' contains such stimulating asides. In the later 19th century America began to look across the Pacific and instinctively welcomed Japan as a progressive friend against backward China. Or again, we all know about the present administration's collective military experience but, Kagan observes, ''in the nine presidential elections between the end of the Civil War and the election of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, every Republican presidential candidate except one had served as an officer in the Civil War.''
        One more throwaway nugget is the fact that from the 1860s to the 1880s, Chile had a larger navy than the United States; in his next volume Kagan will perhaps remind us that in 1939, the Belgian Army was larger than the American Army. Here too is the contradiction in his story. Much of what he says is true. And yet, in his desire to parade his thesis, he sometimes forgets the great historical insight of Marx (Groucho, not Karl): the reverse is also true.
        In many ways America really did withdraw from the temptations and perils of the world. There were exceptions, like the astonishing story of the campaign against the Barbary pirates of North Africa (the Islamofascists of 1804?), when the whole American fleet sailed 4,000 miles to the Mediterranean and the Marines landed on the shores of Tripoli. For all that, by the time this book ends, and for nearly two decades more, no American infantry battalion ever set foot in Europe, and the only great war the American people had ever fought was against each other.
        It's bad form to attribute motive or to read between the lines, but there is a long tradition of works of real scholarship that nevertheless have an ulterior purpose. Kagan has been closely associated with the neoconservative project. Right now that project isn't looking any too rosy, and so it may be understandable if he wants to take time out and look back. He deconstructs the early texts of the Republic, suggesting that Washington's Farewell Address was not as isolationist as its warnings about entangling ''our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice'' might sound. He also points out that John Quincy Adams's 1821 Independence Day speech was a virulent republican assault on monarchical absolutism and not merely an assertion that America ''goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.''
        Maybe so, but we have all been reminded by recent events of where the search for monsters can lead. Will it be surprising if America soon, and at least for a time, turns inward and aloof once more?
