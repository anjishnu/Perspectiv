        ABC said yesterday that it had canceled two of its newest shows, ''Day Break'' and ''Show Me the Money,'' because of low ratings. ''Day Break,'' a drama that featured Taye Diggs reliving the same nightmarish day over and over, will disappear from its 9 p.m. Wednesday spot immediately, to be replaced by two comedies, ''According to Jim'' and ''George Lopez.'' It suffered steady declines in ratings after its debut on Nov. 15, when it took over the time slot from ''Lost,'' on hiatus until Feb. 7. The audience for ''Day Break'' dwindled to a little more than 4 million viewers this week from more than 12 million in the first half-hour of its debut last month. Remaining episodes of the series will be made available on ABC.com. ABC also canceled ''Show Me the Money,'' a game show with William Shatner as the host that was modeled in part on NBC's ''Deal or No Deal.'' But the ABC series, which replaced the Wednesday ''Dancing With the Stars'' results program, was not able to attract more than 7 million to 8 million viewers, less than half the audience for the NBC show. ''Show Me the Money'' will be replaced at 8 p.m. Wednesday by ''America's Funniest Home Videos.''
