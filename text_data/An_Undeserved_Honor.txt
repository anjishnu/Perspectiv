        Re ''Buckeyes' Smith Collects Heisman in a Runaway,'' Dec. 10: The sports media demonstrated their short memory and a disregard for the integrity of amateur sports by awarding Ohio State University quarterback Troy Smith the Heisman Trophy on Dec. 9.
        Less than a year ago, the 2005 Heisman winner, Reggie Bush, faced allegations and reports that that he and his family inappropriately accepted over $100,000 in gifts, which would constitute an N.C.A.A. violation.
        Many reporters blasted Bush in their articles and questioned whether his Heisman should be revoked. Yet, this year, the news media turned the keys to college football's most prestigious individual award over to Smith, who was suspended for two games by his team after accepting money from a booster.
        To Smith's credit, he has made the most of every moment since by playing well and acting maturely. But a disservice is being paid to amateur sports by rewarding him.
        As my grandfather has said in reference to other celebrities, to err is human, to forgive is divine, but to honor is ridiculous.
