        Re ''Congress and the Benefits of Sunshine'' (editorial, Dec. 14):
        Ironically, the Internet has revolutionized the availability of information for almost all of our nation's institutions except the one designed to be the most public and accountable: government.
        The current laws under the Freedom of Information Act are hopelessly dated and make it practically impossible for citizens to gather the most basic of information about what their representatives are doing in Washington.
        Congress has always exempted itself from public disclosure laws. But if it is serious about reform, Congress, like all other federal agencies, should finally resolve to play by the same rules. At the least, all written communications and scheduled meetings between members of Congress and registered lobbyists should be subject to public review.
        Moreover, all documents that the public has a right to see should be accessible on the Web.
        Unfortunately, the administration -- by interpreting freedom of information laws narrowly and making delay or denial of appropriate requests official policy -- has made a transparent government that enables true citizen oversight and engagement an even more distant goal.
