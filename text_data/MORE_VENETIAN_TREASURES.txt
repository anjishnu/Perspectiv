        To the Editor: In ''36 Hours: Venice'' (Dec. 3), Danielle Pergament lends some good advice. But she completely misses the vaporetto in recommending only two fine arts institutions: the Palazzo Grassi and the Giardini della Biennale.
        The Scuola Grande di San Rocco, the Palazzo Ducale and the Accademia, among others, have paintings, sculpture and architecture that instantly eclipse anything at the Palazzo Grassi.
        I would suggest visiting those uniquely Venetian sights before even considering Peggy Guggenheim's house, and I'd skip the Palazzo Grassi entirely in favor of art created prior to this century.
