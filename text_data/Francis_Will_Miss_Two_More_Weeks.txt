        Steve Francis will be out two more weeks as he recovers from tendinitis in his right knee, the Knicks announced Friday. Francis, a starting guard, has been resting the knee since Dec. 7.
        Francis visited a knee specialist, Dr. Ben Shaffer, in Washington on Thursday. Shaffer evaluated two magnetic resonance imaging tests -- one taken in early October and one taken Thursday -- and concluded that the knee was improving.
        Francis will wear a temporary brace and continue a rehabilitation program designed to strengthen the area. Francis will probably be cleared to play when he is examined again in two weeks, right before the Knicks leave for a five-game trip to the West.
        If Francis returns then, he will have missed 10 consecutive games, and 13 of 31 this season.
        Jamal Crawford has replaced Francis in the lineup.
