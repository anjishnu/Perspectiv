        Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday announced the installation of the first 24 of 3,300 steel and glass bus-stop shelters that will eventually replace all shelters on city streets. The shelters are part of a 20-year contract with the Spanish company Cemusa, which will also replace 330 newsstands and install, operate and maintain 20 public toilets. Standing in front of a new shelter outside Borough Hall in Kew Gardens, Mr. Bloomberg said the new shelters were environmentally friendly, and noted that they had seats for waiting passengers. Also yesterday, a justice in State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the city had acted properly in awarding the contract to Cemusa, rejecting lawsuits filed by rival bidders for the lucrative contract. The judge, William A. Wetzel, said the claims by the rivals, JCDecaux and Clear Channel, were without merit, and he ridiculed a charge that Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff had conspired to award the contract to Cemusa as part of an obsession with getting free advertising for the city's unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics.
