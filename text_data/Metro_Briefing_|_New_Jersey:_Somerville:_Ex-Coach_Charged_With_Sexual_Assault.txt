        A former basketball coach and teacher at a Roman Catholic high school was charged yesterday with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old student, the authorities said. The teacher, Pamela Balogh, 39, of Bethlehem, Pa., was arrested and charged in State Superior Court with aggravated sexual assault, criminal sexual conduct, endangering the welfare of a child and other offenses, said Wayne J. Forrest, the Somerset County prosecutor. Mr. Forrest said the assaults on the girl occurred from December 2004 to September 2005 in Ms. Balogh's office at Immaculata High School in Somerville. She resigned from the school in 2005 and has been teaching and coaching field hockey at North Hunterdon High School. The girl recently told family members of the assaults, Mr. Forrest said.
