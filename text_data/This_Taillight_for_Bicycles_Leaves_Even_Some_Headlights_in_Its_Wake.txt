        Bicycle taillights were among the first products in which conventional light bulbs were replaced by light-emitting diodes. The diodes' relatively low power consumption allowed manufacturers to use smaller and lighter batteries.
        At first, L.E.D. taillights suffered from being somewhat dim. But that is not a limitation of the DiNotte Tail Light (www.dinottelighting.com). The lamp, which vaguely resembles a short, fat lipstick tube, holds a three-watt L.E.D., making it more powerful than many bicycle headlights.
        On full power, the light projects a large beam of red light well behind the bicycle. The effect is a bit like carrying a red emergency flare.
        The light, with a suggested price of $129, uses four AA batteries (rechargeables are recommended), and it runs for 3 hours on high power or 12 hours while blinking or on low, a setting that is still significantly brighter than other taillights. It attaches to any bicycle seat post quickly with an industrial O-ring, while the batteries have a separate case and Velcro attachment.
        The aluminum casing is not just for style. The L.E.D.s get hot, so the casing acts as a heat sink to dissipate that energy.
