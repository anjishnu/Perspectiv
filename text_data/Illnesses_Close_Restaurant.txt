        Health officials in Indianapolis closed an Olive Garden restaurant on Friday after receiving more than 300 calls from people who said they had become ill after eating there, the officials said.
        The diners, who complained of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever, said they had eaten at the restaurant since Saturday afternoon, according to a spokesman for the Marion County Health Department, John Althardt.
        Most experienced symptoms for about 36 hours, and at least three were hospitalized, Mr. Althardt said.
        Steve Coe, a spokesman for Olive Garden, part of Darden Restaurants, said the restaurant was working with officials to pinpoint the cause of the illness.
