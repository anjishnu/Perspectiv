        The photographs by Joel-Peter Witkin are described as ''an artful homage to this season's all-important accessory: the hat'' (Style, Nov. 26). And yet, many of these photos display naked women. Removing women's clothes doesn't draw attention to their hats. Instead, the reader's eye goes to the breasts.

        I cried with relief to read that Harriet Brown's anorexic daughter, Kitty, had eaten some cake on her own. I also appreciated the juxtaposition of Brown's article with Joel-Peter Witkin's wonderful photos of models wearing hats. Some were thin, some were buxom, some were neither, yet all were beautiful and sexy. Let's hope that magazine readers become more accustomed to seeing that attractive women need not conform to one body type.
