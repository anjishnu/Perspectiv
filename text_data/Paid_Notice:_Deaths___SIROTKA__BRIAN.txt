        SIROTKA--Brian. It is with great sadness that The Board and Staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. mourn the passing of Brian Sirotka, Controller of Lincoln Center, Inc. for nearly 24 years. A treasured friend and colleague, Brian's careful and diligent approach to challenging issues always resulted in creative solutions, and was a hallmark of his tenure in a challenging position. He will be dearly missed, and we extend our deepest sympathy to Brian's partner for 35 years, John Bryant, and to his entire circle of family and friends. Frank A. Bennack, Jr. Chairman Reynold Levy, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.
