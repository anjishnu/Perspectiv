        Senator John McCain of Arizona has a holiday greeting for a fellow Republican, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, as Mr. Giuliani holds a fund-raiser near Times Square this evening to inaugurate his presidential exploratory committee.
        Mr. McCain has released a list of leaders from the New York metropolitan region for his national fund-raising committee, and it includes some of the biggest Republican names in the New York region. Among them are Lewis M. Eisenberg, former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; Woody Johnson, owner of the Jets; Henry R. Kravis, finance chairman for the Republican convention; Georgette Mosbacher, a major Republican fund-raiser; Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group; and John C. Whitehead, former head of Goldman Sachs.
        ''For activists and primary voters who are looking to see who can go toe to toe with Hillary Clinton, a list like this a cornerstone,'' said John Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. ''It is proven John can do this. It's not proven anyone else can.''
        Asked whether it was a coincidence that Mr. McCain was issuing his list the same day that Mr. Giuliani was holding his lay-down-your-marker fund-raiser, Mr. Weaver responded, ''There are no coincidences in life, but I would guess this would be one.'' He laughed.
        The Giuliani camp declined to comment.
