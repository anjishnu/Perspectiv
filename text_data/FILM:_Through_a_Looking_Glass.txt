        ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' Clint Eastwood's Golden Globe-nominated WWII saga, ''might just be the best Japanese movie of the year,'' says A. O. Scott. A ''harrowing, contemplative'' companion to his film ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' released earlier this year, ''it is, unapologetically and even humbly, true to the durable tenets of the war-movie tradition, but it is also utterly original, even radical in its methods and insights.'' That goes for the ''vivid and varied performances'' of the Japanese cast, and the sensitivity that Mr. Eastwood extends their characters: ''It is hard to think of another war movie that has gone so deeply, so sensitively, into the mind-set of the opposing side.'' The film, Mr. Scott says, is ''close to perfect.''
        Opens today at the Landmark Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street (Allen Street), Lower East Side, (212) 777-3456.
