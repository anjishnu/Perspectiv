        A restored wing of the National Gallery of Ancient Art was inaugurated in Rome yesterday, offering a sneak preview of a three-year project that will transform the 17th-century Palazzo Barberini and vastly increase the museum's exhibition space. The restoration ends a 55-year dispute over ownership of the ground floor between the Culture Ministry and the Defense Ministry, which used the space as an officers club. The club has been moved to a 1936 villa behind the palazzo. The culture minister, Francesco Rutelli, said that by 2009 the museum's collection, including masterpieces by Raphael, Caravaggio and El Greco, would occupy the entire building. ''Palazzo Barberini has returned to its role as a place of culture,'' Mr. Rutelli said of the structure, designed by Carlo Maderno, Francesco Borromini and Gian Lorenzo Bernini for Pope Urban VIII. Some 12 million euros ($15.9 million) from Italy's weekly lottery drawings have been set aside for the next phase of the restoration, which includes the replanting of the palazzo's formal garden.
