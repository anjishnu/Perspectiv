        The judge overseeing the case of a bouncer accused of killing a 24-year-old graduate student in February rejected a motion to recuse herself yesterday, writing that accusations of judicial misconduct were groundless. The bouncer, Darryl Littlejohn, 42, of Queens, who is accused of killing the student, Imette St. Guillen, is now represented by Joyce B. David, a lawyer who accused the judge, Cheryl E. Chambers of State Supreme Court, of improperly directing and assigning lawyers as part of a scheme to make Mr. Littlejohn ''a convenient scapegoat.''
