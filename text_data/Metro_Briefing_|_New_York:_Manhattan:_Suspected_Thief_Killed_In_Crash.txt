        An 18-year-old Harlem man who had just stolen a delivery truck was killed yesterday after he lost control of the vehicle and crashed into the facade of an Upper East Side restaurant, the police said. The man, Eugene Walker, and an unidentified accomplice approached the truck driver, who was delivering breakfast pastries near Lexington Avenue and 74th Street about 3:15 a.m., and pulled him from the truck, the police said. Mr. Walker then drove away in the stolen truck, while his accomplice fled in a dark-colored sedan, the police said. Moments later, Mr. Walker sideswiped a taxi at East 74th Street and Madison Avenue, the police said, then continued onto Second Avenue, where he slammed into Baraonda, an Italian restaurant. Mr. Walker was ejected from the truck, the police said, and later pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital.
