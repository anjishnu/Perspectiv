        MAPLE has new dimensions. Le Cordon Bleu Maple Sugar Chips, above, add crunch to pancakes, French toast and pastries. From cordonbleu.com, a seven-ounce tin is $16.
        Pops' Original Smoked Maple Syrup, from Saxtons River, Vt., is infused with apple- and maple-wood smoke. Of these syrups, the Vermont fancy, with the lightest amount of smoke, is the best for pancakes. Marinades and meat glazes can take the heavier medium amber or Grade A dark.
        They are $7.99 a half-pint, $12.99 a pint, $20.99 a quart from (802) 869-1098 and at smokedsyrup.com.
