        To the Editor: In Mark Bittman's otherwise delightful article, ''Southern California: The East Is West -- The Best Chinese Restaurants'' (Choice Tables, Dec. 3), I was dismayed to find the glowing account of a California restaurant whose menus ''often feature esoteric and very expensive ingredients such as abalone, shark's fin and bird's nest.''
        Across this country, shark fin soup is a delicacy and, most famously in Hong Kong, a must at wedding banquets. The global demand is increasing. In October, a National Geographic article reported the most reliable estimate so far: 38 million sharks are killed annually for their fins. Given the industry's secretiveness, other estimates are far higher.
        In the ''harvesting'' process at sea, sharks are pulled aboard and ''finned,'' meaning their fins are sliced off with a hot metal blade. Then the fish are tossed back alive. Sharks cannot swim without their fins, so they drown or die from starvation. The European Union, which has already banned finning within its borders, announced earlier this year that it would draw up measures to protect sharks globally. The United States -- a country that has also banned the practice within its borders -- should support these measures.
