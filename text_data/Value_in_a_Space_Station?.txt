        Re ''Destination is the Space Station, but Many Experts Ask What For'' (Dec. 5): All of the manned space missions to date, especially those of long duration, have reconfirmed one fact: humans evolved to function with the force of Earth-normal gravity pressing down upon them. Without gravity, we are in trouble.
        How much more experimentation is necessary for scientists to admit that we are not going to Mars without a craft that can simulate at least a fraction of Earth's gravity? They must either shorten the round trip to a few months, or create a craft that can simulate fractional gravity. Otherwise, they are just wasting our money.
