        The United States will shame itself and be responsible for more bloodshed in Iraq if it allows Saddam Hussein to be executed, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, a member of the former dictator's defense team, said Wednesday.
        Describing the trial in which Mr. Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death last month as ''palpably unfair'' and ''egregiously vindictive,'' Mr. Clark said the United States had ''the highest moral and legal obligation'' not to turn Mr. Hussein and his co-defendants over to Iraqis.
        To do so, Mr. Clark said at a news conference here, would be to condemn the convicted men to torture as well as death by hanging, possibly before the end of this year and certainly by early 2007. The case should be reviewed by an international panel of legal experts, and Mr. Hussein should be retried in an international tribunal, Mr. Clark said.
        Mr. Clark, who describes himself as a pacifist and has represented several notorious defendants in the United States and around the world, said he had no doubt who had the power to doom Mr. Hussein, or to spare him. ''The decision will be made by George W. Bush,'' he said. ''Who else?''
        Mr. Hussein is being held at Camp Cropper, an American military prison near the Baghdad airport. There has been speculation that he may be executed at a specially built gallows at Camp Cropper, even though executions carried out by the new Iraqi government take place in a prison in eastern Baghdad.
        Mr. Hussein and two co-defendants were convicted and condemned to death on Nov. 5 for crimes against humanity, the execution of 148 men and youths in a small town north of Baghdad in 1982 and ''widespread and systematic'' persecution of the townspeople for years afterward. A fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison.
