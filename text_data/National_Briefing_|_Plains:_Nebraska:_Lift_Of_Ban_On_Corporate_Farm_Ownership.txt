        A federal appeals court lifted a 24-year-old ban restricting corporate ownership of farm and ranch land to family-owned operations, finding that it interfered with interstate commerce and discriminated against farmers and ranchers living outside the state. A group of farmers and ranchers challenged the ban, claiming it prevented them from forming limited-liability partnerships and contracting with out-of-state corporations to keep costs down.
