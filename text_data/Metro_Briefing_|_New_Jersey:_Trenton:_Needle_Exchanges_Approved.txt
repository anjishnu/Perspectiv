        New Jersey yesterday became the last state in the country to offer needle exchange programs for intravenous drug users, when Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed legislation authorizing a pilot program for up to six towns. The law allows drug users to exchange used syringes for new ones, and provides $10 million for drug treatment facilities. A bipartisan array of legislators who attended the bill-signing ceremony said that such programs could help reduce the spread of H.I.V. in New Jersey, which has one of the country's highest infection rates. But critics say that the government should focus on treatment programs, and that free needles contributed to addictions.
