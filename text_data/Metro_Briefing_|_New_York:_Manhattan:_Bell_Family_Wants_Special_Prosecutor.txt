        Lawyers for the family of Sean Bell, who was fatally shot by the police on Nov. 25, called yesterday for the appointment of a special prosecutor to replace Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, as head of an investigation into the shooting. ''We just believe that a prosecutor who marches in lock step with the New York Police Department is not capable of stepping away from this investigation and doing it appropriately,'' said Neville O. Mitchell, a lawyer for the Bell family, who spoke to reporters outside Police Plaza alongside William Bell, Sean Bell's father. Meanwhile, in Queens, the Rev. Al Sharpton called for the establishment of a permanent federal prosecutor to investigate shootings by the police in New York City.
