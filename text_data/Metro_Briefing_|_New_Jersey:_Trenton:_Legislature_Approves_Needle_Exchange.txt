        New Jersey, the last state in the union that banned syringe exchanges for intravenous drug users, enacted a law yesterday that provides legal access to clean needles. In separate votes, the General Assembly and the State Senate approved a pilot program in six municipalities, as yet undetermined, in which drug users can turn in dirty needles for sterile syringes. Gov. Jon S. Corzine is expected to sign the bill, known as the Bloodborne Disease Harm Reduction Act, into law. The law also provides $10 million for drug treatment facilities.
