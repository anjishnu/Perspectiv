        To the Editor:
        I read with interest, then confusion, Dennis Overbye's essay, ''Back to the Moon! But Why?'' (Dec. 12). While he is lamenting NASA's apparent loss of interest in going to Mars over setting up a permanent lunar base, he seems to be missing the bigger picture.
        NASA's plan is to go to ''the Moon, Mars and beyond.'' A Moon base provides a valuable proving ground for new technologies to be used for exploration as well as shedding light on the human factor of space exploration, i.e., spending months, even years in space.
        Mr. Overbye shouldn't despair. Mars is still the goal. The Moon is simply one more stepping stone on the path of exploration.
