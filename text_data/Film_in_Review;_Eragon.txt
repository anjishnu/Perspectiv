        ''Eragon'' is what happens when misguided studio executives option a novel written by a teenager (Christopher Paolini) with a head full of Anne McCaffrey and Ursula K. Le Guin. Not full enough, however; this boy-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Even the scaly star, a Delft-blue beastie whose tint suggests either royal lineage or hypothermia, seems unsure of her motivation.
        Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, ''Eragon'' boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Ed Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. A hint of the exotic is provided by a dreadlocked Djimon Hounsou -- who seems to be phoning in his lines from a booth in the Bahamas -- while the marvelous Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, playing a steadily decomposing wizard, hisses incantations from a mouth resembling a nicotine-stained graveyard.
        The film's few moments of hilarity are no less welcome for being completely unintended (the young hero's heavy-breathing romp with a strapping male cousin could only have been envisioned by someone completely lacking in subtext radar), though ''Into the sky, to win or die!'' doesn't have quite the same mythic flair as ''One Ring to Rule Them All.'' And if some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience.

        ''Eragon'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some medieval-style violence (impalings, bashing with heavy objects) and dragon-on-dragon mauling.
