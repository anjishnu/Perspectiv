        The Los Angeles Opera has received a $4 million gift to underwrite a series of performances of music by composers affected by the Holocaust, including Alexander Zemlinsky, Kurt Weill, Viktor Ullmann and Franz Schreker. Marilyn Ziering, a Los Angeles philanthropist who is a member of the opera's board of directors, will provide $3.25 million of the gift and has raised $750,000 more, the opera company said. The series, titled ''Recovered Voices,'' will be conducted by James Conlon, the opera's music director, right, who has long championed the works of composers whose lives and careers were interrupted by the Holocaust. It will include two concerts of operatic excerpts in March and full-scale productions of complete operas in future seasons. The excerpts will include pieces from Mr. Schreker's ''Stigmatized,'' Walter Braunfels's ''Birds'' and Ernst Krenek's ''Johnny Tunes Up,'' as well as a complete performance of Mr. Zemlinsky's ''Florentine Tragedy,'' a one-act opera based on the Oscar Wilde play of the same title.
