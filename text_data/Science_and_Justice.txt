        Re ''When Questions of Science Come to a Courtroom, Truth Has Many Faces'' (Commentary, Dec. 5): I agree with Professor David L. Faigman's criticism of the court's ''abdication'' of any responsibility to determine scientific facts, especially given all the recent cases involving science and medicine. So why couldn't the justices use the National Academies as advisers?
        Composed of scientists, physicians and experts in a variety of fields, this nonpartisan organization has a policy and clear guidelines for conflict of interest and balance when assigning members to a committee to examine an issue.
        Since the Supreme Court accepts cases months before they are argued, the academies would have time to study the issues before being consulted.
