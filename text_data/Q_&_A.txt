        The Cold, Clear Air
        Q.  Is it an illusion or is the air in New York City really clearer when it is colder?
        A.  There are some good meteorological reasons that visibility is generally better in New York City on colder winter days, though there are also conditions that can produce very poor visibility in winter, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
        ''The things that reduce visibility are haze and pollutants,'' he said, ''and in general, the air is cleaner in winter, when it is colder. Air systems are more on the go in wintertime, and there are frequent air-mass changes.''
        ''A stagnant air mass, like a stationary summer high-pressure system, allows pollutants to build up,'' he explained, ''but in winter, a low-pressure system, with its attendant cold front, is likely to bring in a breath of clean, fresh air from Canada, where there is less man-made pollution.''
        But weather patterns can breed stagnant conditions in winter, Mr. Miner said, and the effect on visibility can be even worse then. In wintertime, it can be really cold near the ground and much warmer above, a temperature structure that inhibits the vertical mixing that could distribute pollutants over a larger volume of the atmosphere.
        Luckily, Mr. Miner said, such patterns are much rarer than the vigorously moving weather systems that characterize winter in New York.
