        To the Editor:
        ''With the Gate Ajar, a Kingdom in Danger?'' (Nov. 19) gives short shrift to the main reason many city residents choose to live in Gramercy Park -- the children.
        Most of us who have served as ''park mommies'' moved here because the locked park offered a safe place for our children to play. We could leave our child with a neighbor while we ran to get a quart of milk, knowing that not only was someone we trusted watching Junior, but also a secure iron gate fenced him in.
        Now that many parents work and leave their children with babysitters, the need for a locked gate is even more pressing. Ever since the Gramercy Park Hotel was reopened, I have prayed that the current generation of children will still be able to play safely and happily and their caregivers can breathe freely for a few minutes.
