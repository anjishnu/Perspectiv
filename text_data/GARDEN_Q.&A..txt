        Q. We love dwarf Himalayan sweet box (Sarcococca hookeriana var. humilis) for its glossy leaves and for the surprising strength of the tiny flowers' sweet fragrance. Never once nibbled by deer, our two plants have been slowly spreading by underground runners for a dozen years. What is the best way to divide them for use as a ground cover?
        A. In Britain, where they bloom in midwinter, sarcococcas are called Christmas box. But even if yours wait until March or April, you are giving yourselves a present by planning to make more of these underused shade-lovers.
        Your dwarf sweet box is a winner of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's gold medal, given to promote outstanding woody plants (goldmedalplants.org). Joseph Ziccardi Jr., the program coordinator, offers the following tips for successful division.
        Plants should be three years old or older. Divide them in early spring, right after bloom finishes. Use a sharp spade to slice away the clearly separate outer portions; leave the original centers intact.
        Each new division should have 10 to 15 stems. Trim them to roughly 10 inches tall, replant in loose, highly organic soil, and water well. Continue watering until plants are well established.
        ''Watch out for those winter sunny spots which used to be shade before the leaves fell from your canopy trees, '' Mr. Ziccardi warned. ''Sarcococca can burn under these conditions.''
        Your variety is the toughest sweet box, rated hardy to Zone 6. But though it grows faster in Zones 7 through 9, it isn't exactly swift anywhere. For full coverage in two or three years, set plants 12 to 18 inches apart, Mr. Ziccardi advised.

        'Cactus' of the Rain Forest
        Q. My Christmas cactus blooms beautifully, but the paddles are dull and flabby even though I water very little. What causes this?
        A. The cause is probably the ''cactus'' in the name, which leads many gardeners to underwater. Your plant is in the genus Schlumbergera, native to Brazilian rain forests, where it grows on rocks and hangs from trees. It evolved to be watered frequently and then dry out promptly.
        Make sure the potting mix drains well and that the plant never sits in water; then water it more often. It would also be wise to repot if the soil has been unchanged for four years or more.
