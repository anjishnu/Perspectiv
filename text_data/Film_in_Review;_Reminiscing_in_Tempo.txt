        Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Gary Keys  Not rated; 90 minutes
        ''You've got to find some way of saying it without saying it,'' Duke Ellington once advised, and Gary Keys seems to have taken that as his template for ''Reminiscing in Tempo,'' a meandering documentary about Ellington that mixes the then and the now. What is Mr. Keys trying to say with this film? He doesn't say. But Ellington fans will certainly relish the many vintage clips scattered throughout.
        The film starts by dropping in on the birthday parties Ellington's sister, Ruth Ellington Boatwright, used to hold in his memory after his death in 1974. (She died in 2004.) Friends and admirers like Bobby Short and the jazz historian Ira Gitler toss in comments. Most of these folks are not very compelling; one exception is Al Hibbler, who tells of deciding as a child -- though he was blind from birth -- that he would one day be Ellington's vocalist, a goal he eventually achieved. His lovely baritone was long gone by whenever the clip was shot (he died in 2001), but he even sings a little.
        From there the film jumps all over the place in time and subject, Mr. Keys tossing together interviews, performance footage, still photographs and more; in the musical segments, which are extensive, it's often unclear if we're hearing the performers on the screen or if a collage technique is being used. The main destination, though, is unambiguous: it's the Olympics in Mexico in 1968, where Ellington played his ''Mexican Suite.''
        Mr. Keys provides a generous helping of the performance, which he produced. The film quality of this segment isn't great, but other performance clips are, especially Ellington playing ''The Single Petal of a Rose'' and the trumpeter Cootie Williams taking a solo.
