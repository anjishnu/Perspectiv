        Three new albums have taken the top spots on the Billboard chart this week. ''The Evolution'' (La Face), the second record by the 21-year-old R&B singer Ciara, reached No. 1 with 338,000 copies sold; ''Eminem Presents: The Re-Up'' (Interscope), a compilation with tracks by Eminem, 50 Cent and others, is No. 2 with 309,000; and Gwen Stefani's ''Sweet Escape'' (Interscope) opened at No. 3 with 243,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The rest of the Top 10 is mostly recent hits and holiday albums, including Il Divo's ''Siempre'' (Columbia), which jumped 10 spots to No. 6 last week, thanks to an ''Oprah Winfrey Show'' appearance. The most notable movement was downward: last week's top seller, Incubus's ''Light Grenades'' (Epic), had a 65 percent sales decline, sending it to No. 37, the biggest second-week drop from No. 1 in the history of the chart.
