        The death of a 65-year-old woman whose body was found wrapped in a carpet in her Bathgate Avenue apartment on Tuesday night was ruled a homicide yesterday by the medical examiner's office, a spokeswoman said. The woman, identified by her family as Teresa Reyes, had been asphyxiated, her mouth covered with duct tape, the spokeswoman said. Her house seemed to have been ransacked, her relatives said yesterday, although it seemed that nothing was stolen. Ms. Reyes, a cook at a day care center on Davidson Avenue, had not contacted her relatives since early Monday morning and had not been to work since Friday, relatives and a co-worker said. She immigrated from Ecuador more than 20 years ago, they said, and raised her children in the Bronx.
