        The question before us, thankfully, isn't whether the music of the performer who calls himself Danielson is anything a sane person would want to listen to. This being a film review, the relevant question is whether J L Aronson's documentary about Danielson is worth watching. The answer, for about two-thirds of it, is yes. Though ultimately, alas, the movie has a little too much Danielson in it.
        Danielson is a New Jersey man named Daniel Smith who, beginning in the mid-1990s, began drawing a modest amount of attention with some of the oddest Christian rock music on the planet. Often performing with his four siblings and assorted friends as the Danielson Famile, he sings in a deliberate fingernail-on-chalkboard voice that's a very long way from the slick stuff most people associate with Christian rock. Live performances are performance art of a sort: the Famile members dress in nursing uniforms (representative of healing), and as a solo act Mr. Smith (calling himself Brother Danielson) has often dressed as a tree. ''I'm really kind of freaked out by them,'' a concertgoer says in the film, ''and I'm in a metal band.''
        The film traces the birth and evolution of this odd beast, and once you decide the whole thing is not a put-on, you're entranced for a while. A sprinkling of animation adds to the quirkiness. But a little of Mr. Smith goes a long way. Past the one-hour mark, his smugness and pretentious hooey about God using him as an instrument (these songs are the best God could do?) grow more irritating than interesting.
