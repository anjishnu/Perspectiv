        Warren S. Jeffs, the fundamentalist Mormon polygamist leader, was ordered by a Utah state judge in St. George to stand trial on two felony counts of rape as an accomplice. The judge, James L. Shumate of District Court, found probable cause to order Mr. Jeffs to stand trial on the charges, which carry a penalty of up to life in prison. Mr. Jeffs, 51, is accused of performing a ''spiritual'' marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old first cousin in 2001. The girl testified that she told Mr. Jeffs that she did not want to be married to her cousin and did not want to engage in ''husband-wife'' relations but that Mr. Jeffs repeatedly directed that she do so because he said it was ordered by God.
