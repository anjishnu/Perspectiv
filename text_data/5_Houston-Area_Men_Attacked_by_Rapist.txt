        A serial rapist appears to be responsible for five attacks and robberies of young men in an area east of Houston, the authorities here said.
        The most recent attack took place on Nov. 30 in a prominent Baytown subdivision called Tanglewilde. The first attack occurred in April in eastern Harris County, Capt. Roger Clifford of the Baytown Police Department said Wednesday.
        Another attack in eastern Harris County was in September, and the two others in Baytown took place in May and July.
        All five victims have been white men who were alone and attacked in or near their homes in upscale neighborhoods, Captain Clifford said. The attacker is described as a black man in his mid-20s who is about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds with short hair and no discernible accent. He is also clean-cut and well dressed and sometimes wears an earring.
        The assailant has used a gun and knife to abduct his victims, all of whom have been physically smaller than him, but he has not always been successful in forcing them into sexual acts, Captain Clifford said.
