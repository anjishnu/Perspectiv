        Re ''As Trucking Rules Are Eased, a Debate on Safety Intensifies'' (''Loosening the Rules'' series, front page, Dec. 3):
        We take strong exception to your fundamental premise that trucking rules have been eased. The safety rules governing trucking were toughened and strengthened under the Bush administration, as they have been under Republicans and Democrats alike since economic deregulation in 1980.
        Tougher rules issued by the administration since 2000 include those requiring the loss of a commercial driver's license for serious driving violations occurring in a passenger car during off-duty time; the requirement that all new carriers pass a safety audit by the government within the first 18 months of operation; new safety permit rules for carriers hauling hazardous materials; new training requirements for drivers of longer combination vehicles; and more stringent rules for securing loads on trucks.
        Most recently, the American Trucking Association filed a petition with the Department of Transportation to require that all new manufactured trucks be equipped with tamper-proof equipment that would govern the speed of a truck to 68 miles per hour.
        According to Department of Transportation statistics, the large truck fatality rate is at a record low, having declined 11 percent on the Bush administration's watch, and hour-of-service rules have been strengthened for the first time since 1939.
