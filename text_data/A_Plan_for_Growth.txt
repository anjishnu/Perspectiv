        ''Mayor Seeks Plan for City's Population Growth'' (Metro Briefing, Dec. 13) reports that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg intends to develop a plan to make New York City sustainable for future generations.
        The objective is laudable, but there is a critical element missing from the mayor's presentation: a balance between the pressures of economic development and the need for environmental protection, an essential ingredient of all sustainability planning.
        For example, building thousands of housing units in low-lying coastal areas would make them vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme storms. Just as questionable would be building housing on spaces that could be used for future parkland and playgrounds, or restored as ecological habitats.
        As he develops his plan, the mayor must address these conflicting demands if he is to find solutions that bring the city lasting benefit.
