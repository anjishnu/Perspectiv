        This has been a crushing year for American automakers. Slammed by competition from Asian rivals, buffeted by high gas prices and overwhelmed by soaring pension and health care costs, they have decided that they must shrink to survive.
        This year, both Ford and General Motors sent incentive-laced letters to their workers saying basically this: Please consider leaving.
        Signs of the tough times show up in some cold hard numbers from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Planned job cuts in the United States auto industry reached 151,457 this year through November, up 43 percent over the same period in 2005, Challenger said.
        Over all, though, companies have been less inclined to drop the ax. Across all industries, employers based in the United States announced 785,179 job cuts through November, a drop of 19 percent from 2005.
        In November alone, employers added 132,000 jobs, according to the government. So there is some hope for newly unemployed autoworkers, at least those who are willing and able to try a new trade.
