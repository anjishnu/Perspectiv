        Alongside the robots, the graphics, the architectural models and the sundry other projects exhibited in the National Design Triennial, which opened Friday at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, is a trove of wares created for the home. For those not satisfied with window-shopping, a selection of the domestic goods is available for sale in the museum's store.
        For example, the Cantaloupe bowl ($65), above, is a porcelain vessel cast from real melons, designed by Han Feng. Best known for her fashions -- her ready-to-wear collection and her costumes for the recent Metropolitan Opera production of ''Madama Butterfly'' are also represented in the Triennial -- Ms. Han described the bowls as ''something organic, from nature, and cast from molds by hand, so every one is individual.''
        Other exhibition objects for sale include painted metal vases ($180), fruit bowls ($280) and stools that double as side tables (top left; $240) by the New York designer Ron Gilad; the glass-beaded Volcano necklace ($3,500) and Green necktie ($1,750) by the Ladd brothers, a duo based in Brooklyn; and faceted vases in porcelain ($290) and bronze ($1,650) as well as decorative bronze branches with porcelain blossoms ($1,050 or $1,650) by David Wiseman, a young designer in Los Angeles. Also featured are two specially commissioned editions ($10) by Planet Propaganda, a graphic design firm, of the Dunny, a popular series of rabbitlike vinyl dolls from the hipster toymaker Kidrobot.
