        It may not go down as a literary classic, but the coming memoir from Terry McAuliffe, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, will come with a one-two wallop of book parties that few first-time authors can match. Mr. McAuliffe, whose proficiency as a Democratic fund-raiser is rivaled only by his allegiance to Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, will see his devotion repaid with not one, but two parties given by the former first couple early next year. Befitting their shuttle marriage, Mr. Clinton will have his party in New York (Jan. 22, the Four Seasons restaurant) and Mrs. Clinton will hold hers in Washington (Feb. 8, Park Hyatt Hotel).
        It is not clear if Mr. Clinton will attend Mrs. Clinton's party, or vice versa, but Mr. McAuliffe will certainly be at both. The book, to be released next month, is aptly titled ''What a Party.''
