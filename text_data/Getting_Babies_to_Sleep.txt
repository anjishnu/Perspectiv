        Re ''For Getting Baby to Sleep, Sticking to a Plan Is What Counts'' (Dec. 12): The so-called experts cited in this article (with the exception of Dr. Robert Sears) seem to take as a given that everyone's goal is to have a baby who sleeps independently. But what if the goal instead is to have a baby that feels safe, attached and loved?
        There is a reason why ''the biological blueprint in us says we need to be there, to comfort and soothe them.'' In many cultures, putting a baby to sleep by itself would be considered child abuse. I am glad that many parents are listening to their biology instead of the experts and have chosen to ignore advice that counsels us to punish ourselves and our babies at a most vulnerable time.
