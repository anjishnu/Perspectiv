        The State Health Department does not sufficiently monitor the evacuation plans that nursing homes are required to maintain, according to a report released yesterday by the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, left. The report, which Mr. Stringer said was prompted by Hurricane Katrina, also found that the evacuation plans are not accessible to residents and family members; that there are no guidelines for how to evacuate a nursing home if transportation routes are blocked; and that there was no clear authority to decide whether a given home should be evacuated. Mr. Stringer's office, which reviewed plans provided by 40 of 180 nursing homes in the city and interviewed 28 nursing home administrators, asserted that the plans varied widely in length -- from 2 pages to more than 200 -- and were often incomplete. Marc E. Carey, a Health Department spokesman, said the agency had devoted enormous time to planning for a pandemic, including preparing nursing homes, but had not seen Mr. Stringer's report.
