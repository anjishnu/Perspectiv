        The Sundance Film Festival may have been taken over by celebrities and Hollywood studios, but struggling filmmakers still want to go there to hobnob. Delta is making one lucky filmmaker's wish come true with a competition, organized by Gen Art, that begins this month. Five directors will vie for a reward of $10,000, a trip to the festival (including air travel and lodging for two and participation in Delta Sky Lodge festival events), and a pair of international round-trip tickets. The short films can be seen online (www.delta.com/flyinmovies) through Jan. 15 and aboard domestic transcontinental flights Jan. 1 to 12. Delta passengers and online viewers will vote, and the winner is to be announced on Jan 16.  Earlier this month, the 527-room Ritz-Carlton in New Orleans (below) reopened its doors after a 15-month, $100 million renovation. Improvements to the hotel -- its basement and first floor were damaged by Hurricane Katrina -- include more than 8,000 square feet of additional meeting space. There is an introductory starting rate of $169 through Dec. 30 (www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/new--orleans).
