        The models and best friends James Branaman and Tyler Denk were crowned the winners of CBS's ''Amazing Race 10'' on Sunday, but football coverage once again earned NBC the title of ratings champion for the night. According to Nielsen's estimates, which are subject to greater revision for telecasts of live events, the New Orleans Saints' drubbing of the Dallas Cowboys garnered 18 million viewers, putting NBC on top in every hour of prime time. ABC was second among adults 18 to 49, while CBS outperformed it in total viewers for the night, benefiting from an overrun of its afternoon football game. That overrun delayed CBS's lineup by about a half-hour, so that CBS's ''60 Minutes'' (15.3 million), which featured an interview between Anderson Cooper and the Abu Ghraib whistle-blower Joe Darby, was broadcast from about 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. Following it, the ''Amazing Race 10'' finale drew 12.9 million viewers, but it was overshadowed by a two-hour ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' on ABC (14.3 million) from 8 to 10..
