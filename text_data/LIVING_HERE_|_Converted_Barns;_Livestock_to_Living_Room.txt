        WHO -- George Romano, 62, retired supermarket manager, from Patchogue, N.Y.  WHERE -- Lexington, N.Y.  WHAT -- 5-bedroom converted barn
        In 1997, my wife, Anne, and I were shopping for land, and this property had 75 acres. We saw the barn as a negative and figured we'd have it burned down. But the more we looked at it, the more we liked its old beams and simple lines. I took pictures of it to the Farmers' Museum in Cooperstown and they told me it was a German post-and-beam barn that had been built in the 1850s from a kit. The pieces of the barn had been floated on a barge up the Hudson. At that point, I knew we had to save it, so we decided to make it our house.
        My brother-in-law, Robert Thornton, has a construction business on Long Island, where we live. He came up here with 17 other people, mostly friends and family, and got to work. It reminded me of an old-fashioned barn raising. From there, though, it made the transition from barn to house very slowly. The men of the family would come up on weekends to work. At first, we'd sleep at a motel, but eventually we'd sleep at the barn using tarps and boards to keep the heat in. It was years before our wives were willing to stay with us. They'd go to a B & B.
        But now there's a 24-foot stone fireplace built from stones we carried in by ourselves from our woods. There are 2 1/2-inch thick hemlock floors, which are replicas of the original floors, which we had cut at a local sawmill and let dry for two years. There are arched windows with meadow views and a porch where Anne and I love to have tea in the mornings. The conversion took nearly eight years, but it's beautiful. It's been a true labor of love.
