        With membership in the United Automobile Workers union at its lowest level since World War II, the president of the U.A.W., Ron Gettelfinger, left open the possibility on Thursday of a merger with another union.
        During a question-and-answer session on the U.A.W. Web site, Mr. Gettelfinger was asked if he foresaw a merger, a move that would help the union regain some of the influence it has lost as hundreds of thousands of factory jobs have been eliminated.
        ''The U.A.W. has not ruled out merging with other unions,'' Mr. Gettelfinger responded, without elaborating.
        Two decades ago, the U.A.W.'s 1.5 million members made it the country's most powerful union, one able to secure enviable wage and benefit packages so factory workers could live a comfortable life. But the union counted just 557,099 members last year, and since then nearly 85,000 of them have agreed to take buyouts or early retirement offers from General Motors, Ford Motor and the parts maker Delphi.
        As U.A.W. membership has dwindled, Toyota and other Asian rivals have rapidly increased their share of the American market by selling cars built in nonunion plants.
        The U.A.W.'s contract ends next year, and negotiations for a new deal are expected to be particularly hard-fought, as none of Detroit's three automakers are currently earning a profit in North America.
        The U.A.W. has considered a merger in the past. In the mid-1990s, the union announced a formal merger agreement with the United Steelworkers of America and with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. But that effort collapsed.
