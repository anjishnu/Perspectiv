        Re ''A Housecleaning That Swept Out the Ashes of My Marriage,'' (Modern Love, Dec. 10):
        Dena Crosson's article was poignant and I am glad she seems to be on the mend. But I take issue with her assessment that she should have been ''more vigilant'' in attending to the ''red flags'' in her relationship.
        We can't take the temperature of all our relationships all the time. It's exhausting!
        I am sure there are women who have spotless homes, study martial arts and Buddhism and ride motorcycles, and are still left by their husbands. I hope Ms. Crosson comes to enjoy this new chapter in her life.
